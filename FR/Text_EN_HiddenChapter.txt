SiblingReturnFromTomb |= You stood on the stone circle, and the door opened?! A tomb? Grandmasters? A mirror? Jabberwock!
SiblingReturnFromTomb |= I knew there was something evil in that forest. What will you do? Will you really try and become a legend and get that sword to kill it?
SiblingReturnFromTomb |= This is a lot to take in. Why you? We are twins. Surely our blood is the same?
SiblingReturnFromTomb |= It's that damned Fae, isn't it? What did it promise you?
SiblingReturnFromTomb |= Never mind that for now. I need to think. You better start your journey to becoming a legend, I suppose?! I'll do some research at my end and let you know if I discover anything else.
SiblingReturnFromTomb |= Please look after yourself and be careful. And stay away from that rabbit!
SiblingProgress1 |= Good to see you. I am glad you are progressing. I decided I needed to push myself too, so I am going to try to master something. I am not sure what I should try to do yet, though. What do you think? Master knitter? Master animal petter? Master of carrots? Maybe I could do that and give some to your rabbit friend. Rabbit, hare, whatever.
SiblingProgress1 |= Anyway, I must get on, and you should too. I am cooking 'Cabbage a-la-cart', and those monsters won't slay themselves, you know!
SiblingProgress2 |= Well done! It seems like you are making progress. Me? Oh, I am still working my way towards being a mastermind. Did you know I chose exploration as my specialised subject? I've started now so I'll finish!
SiblingProgress2 |= I do hope you solve that monster problem. Every night when I go to sleep, I can briefly feel a presence, but it goes if I light my candles. So I just leave them on all night now. Don't worry, I am safe here, and I am not going to let a hateful monster scare me away!
SiblingProgress3 |= I have some news for you. I went to The Circle and stood on the pad. Guess what happened? It opened! I got inside! It was very creepy in there. I stood by some pool, and three ghosts appeared and talked to me, just as they did to you.
SiblingProgress3 |= A mirror rose up out of the pool, and I could see myself in there, though I seemed a bit different - taller and stronger almost?
SiblingProgress3 |= They said I was worthy of becoming a Master of Exploration. I couldn't believe it! But then, there was a bright light, and I felt dizzy and like my nerves were burning! But a good burning!
SiblingProgress3 |= To cut a long story short, I am now a Master! 
SiblingProgress3 |= Thank you! Your kind words mean a lot. So yes, sibling, I will be around for a very long time! 
SiblingProgress3 |= If you want me to teach you any of my knowledge, I am bound to help you, but you must fulfil my requirements. I am happy to teach you anytime.
SiblingProgress3 |= Oh, I feel so powerful now! I must thank you for inspiring me to greater heights!
SiblingProgress4 |= How goes life? Still progressing with your growing fame, eh? I was over in Copperpot the other day. That's quite a way, you know? Two miles or more, easy.
SiblingProgress4 |= Anyway, this merchant over in Copperpot, he claimed he had seen the Jabberwock. Turned his teeth snow white. Uggghhh.
SiblingProgress4 |= What was I doing in Copperpot? Oh, just noseying around. The people over there are really interesting. Do you know much about them? I just like their hair.
SiblingProgress4 |= Anyhow, the clock stops for no one; must get on.
SiblingProgress5 |= Oh, hello. Faring well? Another notch on your tree or some such thing, eh? Your name is definitely becoming more well-known.
SiblingProgress5 |= I had a couple of people stop by to learn a trick or two, but what I find really noticeable in Quill is a lack of ambition from those who live in the villages. People need to get out into the world and learn its wonderful ways!
SiblingProgress6 |= Hey! It's you. You are lucky to have caught me at home. I have been trying to learn even more about exploring but being a Master, I have pretty much reached my zenith. I wish I could get further west and that broken bridge to the north annoys me like you wouldn't believe!
SiblingProgress6 |= You should see the things I already found. A flower that sings, a weird ore, a plant I can't even pronounce.
SiblingProgress6 |= I have started visiting the other Masters to learn their ways. It's fascinating. I am levelling up, as the ancient expression says.
SiblingProgress7 |= Here you are! More famous than, er, a very well-known pie or person or whatever.
SiblingProgress7 |= I am addicted to pets. I find lost ones on my travels. They tell me all sorts of things, you know? I walk with the animals, talk with the animals. Grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals. I do a lot!
SiblingProgress7 |= They help me feel safe from that horror in Toughwood. I hope you get to kill it soon. Its hatred pours out of that evil forest, but I have a shield of fluff and a heart that can't be darkened.
SiblingProgress7 |= So get your backside in gear!
SiblingProgress8 |= Hello, you. I haven't been long back from more exploring. I've seen things you wouldn't believe.
SiblingProgress8 |= Some of those things could drive a sane person batty.
SiblingProgress8 |= Have you been anywhere interesting lately? Oh, back into that tomb, eh? Getting close now, you superstar!
SiblingProgress8 |= Keep going. Never give up! Never surrender! That is your quest.
SiblingProgress9 |= Here you are! Almost a legend and my own flesh and blood! How far we have come!
SiblingProgress9 |= The only difference is that I will always look the same as I always was, and you will have to scratch other people's bottoms for a thousand years. \nAm just teasing. 
SiblingProgress9 |= I would offer some advice, but you are so nearly there! Come see me when you have what you need. I have been doing some things of my own. Hush-hush for now. Take care.
SiblingFindJabber |= You got the sword! You are indeed an absolute legend! I couldn't be prouder right now. My own sibling, raised in a shoe but kicking arse.
SiblingFindJabber |= Now your biggest challenge awaits. Do you think you have what it takes to kill that foul creature?
SiblingFindJabber |= Well, I suppose you don't even know where it hides and seeps its poison? Well, I have you covered. My mastery was destined. I know exactly where to find it and how to lure it out.
SiblingFindJabber |= There is a rhyme I discovered on my travels...
SiblingFindJabber |= "In the Toughwood very dark,\nYou will find the hatred heart.\nWear a charm of Hyalite,\nAnd in a storm you'll find your fight.\nThrust the blade of light so deep\nAnd love and hope the land shall keep."
SiblingFindJabber |= Soooo, it seems that you need this Hyalite to forge into a charm. It's a good thing you have me, eh? 
SiblingFindJabber |= I took the liberty of using that weird ore I once told you I'd found and getting the Smithy in Copperpot to forge the charm for you. He said it was the hardest metal he had ever worked with. It will cost you a hug. Just kidding. It's yours.
SiblingFindJabber |= Take it and your sword and go free this land of hatred. And you better beat it. I don't want to be crying over your bones, lazybones.
SiblingMeetupT1 |= It's you! You came! It is so good to see you! I hope you are well. I am glad you found the place!
SiblingMeetupT2 |= I am sorry if I am excitable, I made a discovery and it is just so exciting. Have you heard of the Grandmasters? I just came from The Circle to the east of here. There is a strange door there, set into the rock. I have been dreaming of that door more and more recently. I have been researching it and believe it is where the Grandmasters lay buried. They were the ones who signed the Agreement and guard the Mirryr. There is a pad before the door that grants entry to those of high potential. I tried standing on it, but nothing happened. Perhaps you should try?
SiblingMeetupT3 |= Forgive me! We haven't seen each other since I left, and here I am blathering on about ancient secrets. Come, let us go inside and catch up properly...
SiblingMeetupT4 |= ...so that's your whole tale eh? Well, it all sounds fanciful but please take care. Be careful what you wish for!
SiblingMeetupT5 |= Oh my! Look at the time! My dandelion says it's time for me to go to a prior engagement.
SiblingMeetupT6 |= It was great to see you. If you have any progress, let me know how it goes. And stay clear of Toughwood! That place gives me the chills. I am sure I am being watched by something there that does not like me. I can feel hate seething in the air. My heart is strong though...it won't get me!
SiblingMeetupT7 |= Take care of yourself and see you again soon.
GrandmasterIntroT1 |= We are the Grandmasters. We guard the way to Opal, the home of the Goddesses. You have passed the door and are deemed worthy to look in the Mirryr. 
GrandmasterIntroT2 |= Stand now and gaze into the glass and see if you are worthy.
GrandmasterIntroT3 |= What is this?! You are not who you seem. You have no mastery over anything. Yet the Goddesses see more in you than anyone that has been here before.
GrandmasterIntroT4 |= This is most unusual indeed, but the Mirryr has spoken.
GrandmasterIntroT5 |= You must still prove your worth, though, to eventually enter Opal.
GrandmasterIntroT6 |= I am The Wright. I was the one who forged the tools and weapons during the war with the Fae. When the Agreement was signed, I sacrificed my life so that my knowledge was bound between the two worlds and would never be lost or misused.
GrandmasterIntroT7 |= My task for you is a long and difficult one.
GrandmasterIntroT8 |= There exists an ancient creature, hidden in the darkest, deepest depths of Toughwood, that spreads pure hatred throughout the land.
GrandmasterIntroT9 |= No mortal weapon can kill it. But one exists that can pierce its dark heart...the Vorpal Sword.
GrandmasterIntroT10 |= The blade was forged by my own hands long ago but may only be wielded by one of pure legend.
GrandmasterIntroT11 |= The sword was lost during the war, but I can give you the mould to forge a new one. I will gift you this mould if you can prove yourself such a legend. A legendary sword for a legendary wielder.
GrandmasterIntroT12 |= To become a legend, you must raise your Renown with us Grandmasters. Reputation gained will unlock Renown levels, granting you gifts.
GrandmasterIntroT13 |= As a token of goodwill, take this Lens I made long ago. It may lead you to somewhere very special and useful.
GrandmasterIntroT14 |= Go now and become the legend you are destined to be. Win the sword and slay the Jabberwock.
GrandmasterIntroT15 |= Do this task for me, and you are one step closer to immortality and the prizes that lay within the palace of the Goddesses, Opal.
GrandmasterIntroT16 |= Farewell.
StonecrownJWT1 |= My hero! You did it! You slew the creature of hate, and now there is no more hatred in the land. You are a true legend, and I am so proud of you right now.
StonecrownJWT2 |= Teamwork makes the dream work, though, so I hope I get my name mentioned in the history books for my part.
StonecrownJWT3 |= Oh glorious day! Go see those Grandmasters forthwith!  Hurray!
PaigeUnwell |= We need your help. I never used to be this filled with bad feelings. A suffocating spirit has entered everyone here in Woemarsh. It's as though there is something in the water. 
PaigeUnwell |= I am convinced from my research that whatever has tainted us is beyond this gate. Please help us. I was told you were the one who could. 
PaigeUnwell |= I have this book that may help. So, when you have what is needed, meet me back here.
PaigeEnterDreadwaters |= You have the means to cleanse the Unwell? Then I shall open the gate for you.
PaigeEnterDreadwaters |= Be warned. You are about to enter Dreadwaters. Avoid HIM at all costs. The candles we placed everywhere keep HIM contained within. Do not let HIM get you. There may be a way to buy time if he sees you, but I do now know of it exactly. Take great care!
PaigeOutro |= You did it! Already I feel so much better! It's like a huge weight of hatred has been lifted. Goddesses bless you. Please take this book as a reward. It tells you more about us folks of Woemarsh. You may find it insightful. Oh, joyous day!
Paige TurnerINTRO |= Welcome to Woemarsh. I am Paige, the local historian and librarian. A word to the wise, things are not right here lately, so please forgive us if any of us are a bit short with you, we really can't help it, and I have a theory why. P.S, you are ugly.
Mason MakerINTRO |= I'm the local smithy, what of it? If you need anything, you better not have candy money.
Gage MakerINTRO |= Tongs of fire! What do you want? Can't you see I have better things to do, like breathe?
Ava GanderINTRO |= Hello. Nice to see a new face as long as you are spending money in our shop. Otherwise, I couldn't care less who you are.
Goose GanderINTRO |= Yes, I'm Goose. Do you need something? Whatever our shop sells is all we have, so don't go asking for anything else
Sal LoonINTRO |= Have to pardon me love, but everyone has the grumps lately. Can't blame the beer on this one, as our ales make you forget everything. I'm Sal by the way.
Raven LoonINTRO |= What do you want? Raven's my name, and I like the colour black. It's dark. Darker than a tomb at midnight. I can tell you have darkness in you too. I would like that, but I hate everything right now.
Sage OnionINTRO |= I'm Sage the local healer. Pop by the apothecary anytime. Just don't waste my time with tiny spots or little coughs. Or anything, really.
Pearl OnionINTRO |= I don't like the look of you. Vale?  Thought so; you stink of pigs and backwardness.
Charlotte OnionINTRO |= Are you talking to me? Are you talking to me?? I don't see anyone else here. You are driving me nuts!
Lewis FlushingINTRO |= Sorry can't really chat much. Welcome though. Got a headache and not feeling my usual cheery self.
SiblingProgress10 |= A Vorpal Sword, eh? Aren't they weapons of darkness? Well, if that's what the Grandmaster says, then you must have one. And yet again, I am a fountain of knowledge for you to drink from.
SiblingProgress10 |= From what I gather, Vorpal Swords are made from Abysstone. And where do you get that rarest of metals? Well...er...it's basically Wyrm poop. However, to get the Wyrm to poop it out, we need to feed it a certain foodstuff.
SiblingProgress10 |= I don't know what that is, but Old Mother Hubbard may know. If she does help you, then feed that to the Wyrm and collect its poop.
SiblingProgress10 |= You don't know where the Wyrm is?! Well, neither do I, and I have been everywhere. I expect it is somewhere underground, though! 
SiblingProgress10 |= I'll do some digging. Not literally. You go see Old Mother Hubbard and come back if you can get the recipe.
MotherHubbardWyrmRecipe |= Oh, hello! I was just thinking about you when up you pop, like some sort of corn that pops.
MotherHubbardWyrmRecipe |= A Wyrm? Laxatives? My dear, I don't make recipes to give people the squirties! Instead, I bake goods that soothe the tum and are easy on the bum.
MotherHubbardWyrmRecipe |= Yet, seeing how this is to rid the land of evil, I will help. I do have something in my old cookery book that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.
MotherHubbardWyrmRecipe |= Here it is. Lambton Pie. Baked in ancient times to celebrate the killing of a particularly nasty wyrm. Of course, we don't want to kill it, but this is one spice the wyrms won't like!
SiblingPieMade |= Oh, well done! That was unnervingly easy. I was expecting you to go on some big old fetch quest.
SiblingPieMade |= Well, while you were gone, I had a rummage through my library, and what would you know? Well, not as much as I now do. There's a passage in a book I found called 'Legendary Wyrms - Where are they?' that says a monstrous Wyrm the size of a tunnel dwells in the depths of Woemarsh.
SiblingPieMade |= I can't recall seeing any mines or caves in that region, but you can bet your last candy it will be in Dreadwaters, which was once a cave-dwelling community. Try there first.
SiblingPieMade |= And please don't let Daddy Long Legs get you.
FairweatherHAVECHILDREN |= The time has come! Age creeps upon you humans like a mould.\nAs agreed in our contract, your shell must be passed to me.\nThe time to choose your next incarnation is upon us.\nYour essence and strength will add to theirs, and so the dance goes on.\nChoose now, and choose wisely...
FairweatherNOCHILDREN |= The time has come! Age creeps upon you humans like a mould.\nAs agreed in our contract, your shell must be passed to me.\nThe time to choose your next incarnation is upon us.\nI see you have no apparent heirs, so I present a fine choice of orphans from The Shoe.\nChoose now, and choose wisely...
FairweatherUPROOT |= So be it! All your possessions and skills will transfer to your chosen heir. Friendships you have forged will drop slightly. Your life will begin anew. If your chosen heir is under 18, time will pass and you will begin at 18 years of age.
FairweatherCHANGEOUTRO |= A fine choice I am sure. Come Shell, into the burrow.\nI shall see you again soon, Dreamer.
CircleTombTaskName |= The Circle and the Tomb
CircleTomb1 |= Find the pad in the Circle
CircleTomb1Desc |= Stand on the pad in The Circle. You can find this region east of Stonecrown. The pad sits below a large mysterious door.
CircleTomb2 |= Enter the tomb
CircleTomb2Desc |= Enter the tomb in The Circle and explore inside.
ReturnSiblingTaskName |= Return to your sibling
ReturnSiblingDescription |= Return to Stonecrown to your sibling's house and tell them of your discovery.
ChickenMissingValeIntro |= Oh, come to help me find my chickens have ya? Something was creeping about last night and scared em off. I found droppings leading north, but that's it. If you find em, can you bring em back to their coop? They won't have left the Vale I'd wager. Probably gone somewhere quiet and secret.
ChickenMissingValeOutro |= Oh, you found the little beggars! Thanks muchly. There's been strange stuff happenin' lately. Strange noises, bad moods, trees bent out of shape. Strange stuff is brewing for sure. I heard more chickens had gone missing up in Summerdown. You should check out the noticeboard in Poppyhill maybe? See if folks need help like I did. Anyway, here's yer reward.
ChickenMissingSDIntro |= How sweet of you to help me with the most fowl issue. My three little feathered friends have run away. I heard some strange growling in the night, and when I got my slippers on and looked out of the window, I saw nothing. It was too dark. I went outside with my lantern, and my poor cluckers had fled the coop. Please find them, poor little dears.
ChickenMissingSDOutro |= Oh, Goddesses bless you! My little friends are back. I hope whatever scared them stays away. Something has been wandering around, and folk in the village have been muttering about odd happenings and a strange taint in the air. Seems to have gone for the moment, but keep your wits about you if you wander into the darker places!  And by the way, you might want to visit Mellowbrook. A Wanderer told me someone there had a notice up for yet more missing chickens.
ChickenMissingMFIntro |= Badger! Badger! Oh, it's you. I shall drop the act. Need your aid. My chickens have taken fright at something and ran off south. Bring them back to their coop, and I'll pay you and think more kindly of you. Beep Beep! Oh, sorry, I forgot.
ChickenMissingMFOutro |= Oh, you got them. Excellent. I hope whatever scared them has gone for good. There is an ill wind blowing lately. I would avoid Toughwood if I were you. There is definitely something amiss in there.
MISSING_CHICKENS_1_VILLAGER_GOSSIP |= Lost chickens, you say? I heard some clucking when I was in the woods recently. Funny-sounding cuckoos I thought!
MISSING_CHICKENS_2_VILLAGER_GOSSIP |= Lost chickens, you say? I heard some clucking when I had a romantic walk recently.
MISSING_CHICKENS_3_VILLAGER_GOSSIP |= Lost chickens, you say? I heard some clucking when I was in the village.
LemmySippFoundCuckoo |= Ah! Excellent! But do not think that I am going to do everything for you! You seem to have a bit of intelligence about you, so I think you should try to make the cure yourself.
LemmySippFoundCuckoo |= Head to the Powder Station in the preparation room where Boots does his good work and interact with it. We will make a chemist of you yet!
LemmySippMadeItem |= Oh, well done! You made it. If you ever want to use our powder station, we will charge you a nominal fee of 5 Brass per item. We don't allow youngsters to use the Cream station or Potion station, as they are a bit too dangerous for young fingers!
GoodStoreTrialTaskName |= Good Store Help
GoodStoreTrial1 |= Speak to Icabod
GoodStoreTrial1Desc |= Go to the Goods Store in Candlewych Village at 9 am on Day 11 and speak to Icabod Moon.
Icabod MoonGoodStoreIntro |= Ah, thank you for coming! All you have to do for now is just serve any customers that come in. Just interact when they are standing at the counter. If they want to barter, please try to land your arrow in the green section! Usually, a shop owner can change stock and set prices, etc., but please just serve anyone that comes in for now. I will return at 1 pm.
Icabod MoonGoodStoreOutro |= Thank you for that. I hope it all went well. Here's 15 Brass for your troubles. You should try owning a store one day. It's so much fun to keep an eye on stock and be flexible to the demands of your patrons. It's also a great way to earn Reputation!
WoemarshWandererTalk |= Off into Copperpot, are you? I would watch yourself in that village if I were you. Something is amiss, that's for sure. Used to be such a warm, friendly lot. They seem much colder these days. Something ain't right in the world. Watch yourself!
WoemarshGiftRejection |= I won't accept any gifts from you.
Mason MakerINTROPW |= Greetings! I'm the local smithy. We are indebted to you for what you did, although don't go thinking that means extra discounts.
Gage MakerINTROPW |= Hey, it's the purifier of water! Welcome! You must be pretty brave to have been through Dreadwaters! I am Gage. Wish I was as brave as you!
Ava GanderINTROPW |= Hello. Nice to see a new face. I heard about your exploits. I saw Daddy long Legs once, so it must have been quite the shock if you saw him!
Goose GanderINTROPW |= Yes, I'm Goose. Do you need something? I have been a trader all my life, and due to our little 'curse' I will probably be one for a long time!
Sal LoonINTROPW |= Nice to meet a local legend! Bad things in the water are never good for business. I rely on that water to make the ale go a bit further, but shhh, trade secret.
Raven LoonINTROPW |= Did you see Daddy Long Legs in Dreadwaters? He is, like, my hero. I bet he kicks all sorts of arse, and I bet his crib is off the scale dark! I'm Raven by the way. I changed my name from Percy to reflect my hobbies.
Sage OnionINTROPW |= I'm Sage, the local healer. If you need anything after your scary quest, then I'm your man.
Pearl OnionINTROPW |= Hello. Nice to meet you. Do you like dressing up too? We here in Woemarsh continue the traditions of our ancestors.
Charlotte OnionINTROPW |= Woah it's you! The cleaner of wells. You could have at least got rid of Daddy long Legs, so we don't have to burn those stinky old candles anymore! I'm Charlotte, by the way. Last name is Onion, probably because I make you cry.
Lewis FlushingINTROPW |= Hey there! I'm Dennis. Not really. My name is Frank. Ok, ok, it's Mac. Charlie? Oh, ok, it's Lewis. I just can't be serious, man! My disposition is to be always sunny and a delight. If you know any good pranks, chances are I did it first. Annoys the others, but life for us is pretty long, so gotta keep it fun!
FairweatherRepProgress1 |= I see you have scratched the moss from your first milestone. Keep clawing my child. Eventually your nails will be dirty, but the stone will be clean, and you will see your name etched on it. Your destination will become closer with each milestone you scrape away.
FairweatherRepProgress2 |= Another step down the road. So many ways to raise your legend, but take small steps. We do not want you to trip and break your bones.
FairweatherRepProgress3 |= Your progress excites! Your potential seeps across the land like syrup. Soon your sweetness will cover it. It is intoxicating to smell.
FairweatherRepProgress4 |= Keep going, my friend. Your reputation rises, and the rewards are beginning to flow like the drink you call beer. Keep a steady hand and a keen eye on the prize. You are nearly halfway there, friend.
FairweatherRepProgress5 |= Yet another line in the mud stepped over. Your presence grows and my fur stands on end at the possibilities. Stride on and never be slowed, friend.
FairweatherRepProgress6 |= Quill awaits your return like autumn awaits the coming snows that hide from the sun. Winter never hides here, though. It is eternal. You will become the winter, eternal.
FairweatherRepProgress7 |= Closer and closer, the beetle walks to the nail. Do all you can, friend, to reach your destiny. You are becoming so, so close little beetle. Let that foul Jabberwock fall upon your spike!
FairweatherRepProgress8 |= Can you feel it? The power flowing through you? Can you feel the admiration of your kind? Do you bask in the warmth of adulation?\nDo not let fame and fortune cloud your mind at this late stage. The end of your task grows near, but it is merely the first of three. Remain focussed and the world will spin in your palm. You do know that your world spins, I hope?
FairweatherRepProgress9 |= One more step to go. Be brave my friend. I can feel anticipation coursing through you. Your foe has tried to intimidate you, but your mind must be clear. Soon you will face your fears and put them to rest.
FairweatherRepProgress10 |= A legend!  I am impressed and even proud of you, my good friend. The hardest part is yet to come, though. Do you have what it takes?
FairweatherTaskComplete |= A fine feat for one so young. A legend and more. Hatred removed from the land, and your potential glows like a furnace. You have trials ahead, but for now, savour the sweetmeats of victory, for you have earned your place at the high table. The dream goes on, but your waking will come.
DDLSafePassageT1 |= Fear not not not. He told me you were to be left alone. We made made made a trade. Seeking the Wyrm you are.\nThat door. Down, down, down you must go. To the bottom. Then safe from me, yes you are. Safe, safe, safe. Now go go go!
PottINTRO |= Well met again, dreaming one\nName is Pott, recall our fun?\nI asked you questions very deep,\nLong ago, when you did sleep.
PottINTRO |= Lost your kin, but don't be glum,\nA legacy is yet-to-come.\nThe farm is yours and I your friend,\nWill dust the hearth and beds to mend.
PottINTRO |= What next for you, I would guess?\nDreams of doors, so seek it yes?\nNorth Gate beckons, and the world outside,\nAdventures many and pigs to ride.
PottINTRO |= Another gift I give to you,\nPott by name and nature too!\nThis will gather reputation,\nSo off you go without hesitation!
PottINTRO |= See the world and fill the jar,\nMake friends near, do tasks afar.\nSlay many beasts...attack, parry, block!\nOwn many shops and raise your stock.
PottINTRO |= Seek the ones that lay below,\nThose who sleep from long ago.\nThen you can a legend be,\nGo now and make history!
