Hello young one.

I feel a bit awkward writing this, but last night I had a dream where a giant rabbit visited me. It told me all about you and of things to come. It is Summertide tomorrow and I may get chosen to be the Herald. I just wanted you to have a little gift that I keep locked up in the old ruined tower at the bottom corner of the Burial Grounds. 

You have a great future ahead of you.
Jacob
