UI_FamilyLedger_Orders_Help |= Each family member has their own page in this section, though babies cannot be given orders, you monster.\nSimply choose which thing you want them to do and click in the empty sections of the scheduler. You can drag-click to cover multiple sections. Simply click again to blank a filled section if you want it empty.
UI_FamilyLedger_Gathering_Help |= Gathering expeditions let you send you family members - except babies - out into the world to collect valuable items and maybe even to learn something!\nThe Vale is the default region as it is safe and familiar to all, but you can change this to send them off to other places that you have discovered. Be aware though, kids cannot go into perilous areas such as Simplewood - much too dangerous!\nThe stars underneath the Destination name show the maximum quality of the items that the Gatherer can bring back at the end of an expedition to that region. The number of stars is increased with the Gatherer's Experience. Some experience is gained each time a region is visited, but the amount gained depends on the person's success (if in a Perilous area) and upon their Mood - they will learn much more quickly if they are happy about going! \nThe Gatherer's Stats are listed on the right-hand page. Stats that are relevant to success in the selected destination region are highlighted. If these seem particularly low then it may be better to raise these stats - temporarily with the Meal from the Outfit, or permanently by completing Orders - before sending the Gatherer to that Destination.\nStats that have been temporarily improved will be shown in green, whereas those that have been lowered will be red.\nThe three Outfit slots allow you to give equipment and food to the Gatherer to help with their expedition and give some control over the items that they bring back.\nThe first two slots are for tools - each tool allows the Gatherer to collect any five items that you would be able to collect when using that tool in the selected Destination region.\nIf nothing is placed in the tool slots then the Gatherer will return with up to ten items that can be collected by hand: flowers, fruit or herbs.\nThe three Health Hearts show the Gatherer's fitness for combat. One Heart is lost each time a person is injured when fighting monsters. After three serious injuries the Gatherer will return home in a bad mood, and will take to their bed until fully recovered. Of course, you can give them 'get well soon' presents while they are there.\nFinally, the Progress bar shows how long the Gatherer will be away from home. Once they've set off there is no calling them back - so be sure you can spare them for a while before you send them!
