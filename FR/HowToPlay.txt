Name|How to make friends (or enemies) and influence people
Text|You can gain Friendship Points (FP) by helping folk and raising friendship.\nAll Quillians have their likes and dislikes, and finding out about these can be the key to your relationship with a person.\nRegular gifts of liked or loved items will encourage people to look forward to your visits; tell you their life stories; share <link:proverbs>proverbs<link> and gossip about their neighbours; allow you to <link:itempermissions>take<link> things from their land, or even eventually give you access to their valuable family heirlooms! People are always particularly touched if you remember their birthdays...\nFolk will sometimes drop rather heavy hints for items with a particular <link:traits>trait<link>. Gifting a suitable item will make them grateful enough to answer your questions about other villagers, collectable items or some interesting lore.\nConversely, people will become much less well-disposed and helpful to you if you hurt them; give them things that they dislike, or mess up their homes.
