Item90_Rating3 |= I swear I caught a beautiful Cursefish when the leaves were as red as my grandma's face that time she swore at me for standing on her foot.
Item90_Rating4 |= Cursefish hearts are made from farts. So to make them stout, let it out!
Item113_Rating1 |= Got a Journeyman skill rod? I certainly don't, but if I did, I'd get better Mudkipper.
Item113_Rating2 |= Mudkipper just loves the golden colours of Autumn. Hypnotises them
Item113_Rating3 |= Lazy, sunny afternoon, Mudkipper has no mind to worry.
Item113_Rating4 |= Isn't it strange how Mudkippers get excited by rain?

Item449_Rating3 |= Make sure you boost your Constitution before catching quality Swamflatch.
Item449_Rating4 |= In a book I read, they said Swamflatch loved the strange weather events that befall Tir Na Nog. No idea who found that out.
Item447_Rating1 |= Flickerfin! I remember! When bubbles boil in pinkest pools, Flickerfin don't make no fools. Or something along those lines.
Item447_Rating2 |= Nab a Flickerfin with an Adept rod for extra taste!
Item447_Rating3 |= I would guess you would need to boost your Constitution to get better Flickerfin. Goddess knows how I know that.

Item448_Rating1 |= Ye shall have a Fishy, O a Fishy Wishie, when the bubbles come in.
Item448_Rating2 |= A legendary Rod can definitely add quality to Fishy Wishie.
Item448_Rating3 |= Only smart people catch the best Fishy Wishie. A smart person told me that, though he was suspiciously fishless.

Item484_Rating2 |= I knew a fella who always used an Adept Sickle to harvest his Pumpkins.

Item10_Rating2 |= I tasted Nightberry once. Was sour. Should have got the old Master slingshot out.

Item10_Rating4 |= Nightberries never fall foul, when in the presence of a bushy owl.
Item450_Rating1 |= If people love you, then apparently Sugar Plums absorb that for extra sweetness.
Item450_Rating2 |= Ding-a-ding a ding-a-ding! Sugar Plums you shoot with Sling. Ding-a-ding a ding-a-dong. Make sure it's an Expert one.
Item450_Rating3 |= I ate a Sugar Plum once. Plucked during the strange mists that seep over Tir Na Nog.
Item450_Rating4 |= Sugar Plums eh? Well, it is said they sprout big n juicy around those who are jinxed. Weird!

Item96_Rating4 |= If you want better Little sap, take a pet, as easy as that!
Item324_Rating1 |= Cuckoo Dew loves the morning sun. Just like the Cuckoo itself.
Item324_Rating2 |= Did you know Cuckoo Dew is stronger in the summer?
Item324_Rating3 |= Rain makes Cuckoo Dew full of vigour, so it is written.
Item324_Rating4 |= Cuckoo Dew is known to be more potent on days when markets are on. Must be the noise or the smell of hot sausage.
Item15_Rating1 |= Barley is best harvested in the second week of Summer. Take heed!

Item15_Rating3 |= Barley is better grown, with sheep poo it has been known.

Item14_Rating4 |= Fertilise your Wheat with sheep poo. That's what the best farmers recommend.
Item492_Rating1 |= Heard this song? Oh evening Rose with petals fair, comb you smooth and stroke your hair.
Item492_Rating2 |= Pink Roses in Spring are just the most wonderful thing!
Item492_Rating3 |= You would expect rain to dampen Pink Rose's power, but it actually makes them flower. Which rhymed. I am a poet and I don't know it!
Item492_Rating4 |= Roses are so nice, aren't they? Especially I find, on even-numbered days.
Item491_Rating1 |= I like to chew on a Thistle in the afternoon. Tastes sweeter, but it's still a stupid idea.
Item491_Rating2 |= Don't fall on Thistles! Unless it is what they used to call the 'Fall'. That's Autumn to you and me. Simpletons.
Item491_Rating3 |= Thistles really do prefer those who are tougher.
Item491_Rating4 |= Seems to me, you live your life, like a Thistle in the wind. Strong and determined.
Item490_Rating1 |= As the sun rises, so the Sunflower flourishes.
Item490_Rating2 |= Obvious, but Sunflowers are better in summer. Who would have thought?
Item490_Rating3 |= When it's really hot, get those Sunflowers picked for extra goodness.
Item490_Rating4 |= First week of summer is just so ideal if you want to harvest better Sunflowers.
Item489_Rating1 |= The Dawn brings the Orchid, yawn.
Item489_Rating2 |= Winter's freezing grip really adds beauty to Orchids.
Item489_Rating3 |= If you are not alone when picking Orchids, then for some strange reason, they are better quality. Crazy, I know.
Item489_Rating4 |= Mild weather is truly nice for Orchids to stretch their little flowery, erm...arms.
Item344_Rating1 |= If you can actually see them in the fog, then Grave Lilac is best picked then. Whoever found that out was a nutter.
Item344_Rating2 |= The frozen graves of ancient men are catnip to Grave Lilac. Creepy plant!
Item344_Rating3 |= "Pick them at night!" shouted the old man. I found out later he meant Grave Lilac and not bogeys.
Item344_Rating4 |= Hey! Shhh! Turn your lantern off if you want better Grave Lilac. Don't let them see you coming!
Item345_Rating1 |= Wanting a proverb? Bloodfew doesn't taste like *****, Under the darkening evening light.

Item345_Rating4 |= Day 2. Bloodfew. That's all I will say.
Item348_Rating1 |= I once picked a Primrose after lunch, and it shone like gold in my lover's eyes.
Item348_Rating2 |= Spring Primroses! Oh, they smell so nice!
Item348_Rating3 |= My grandpa loved to stick a Primrose in his ear on a windy day. He said you could hear the quality. Daft as a brush.
Item348_Rating4 |= Primrose must have a thing for the second week of Spring.
Item346_Rating1 |= Poppies! Now I have your attention; if you want better ones, pick em in the morning.
Item346_Rating2 |= The Autumn leaves blow, and Poppies get better, you know?

Item346_Rating4 |= There's a saying I made up...Get yourself happily wed, To get better poppies, erm, on your head? I need practice.
Item347_Rating2 |= Spring is a glorious time, especially for Bowing Nancy fans.
Item347_Rating3 |= Bowing Nancy loves it windy. That's a fact.

Item471_Rating1 |= The White Rose of Loverwood! Pick in the evening to make them specialererer.
Item471_Rating2 |= Here's a hint...pick White Roses in Spring.

Item452_Rating4 |= Legend tells of fairy realms with colourful fogs that make Funflowers dance like crazy! Proper raving!
Item456_Rating1 |= I once found a piece of paper nailed to my door that said 'Pick Songstrells in the morning'. I think they got the wrong house.
Item456_Rating2 |= Did you hear that shout last night? "Songstrells at dawn! Songstrells at dawn!" it said.
Item456_Rating3 |= Get married and pick Songstrells. The plant of the fairies just loves the smell of wedded bliss.
Item456_Rating4 |= Springtime always puts a song in my heart. Works for flowers, too, apparently.
Item493_Rating1 |= The song says, "Chamomile glows bright, afternoon deligggghht."
Item493_Rating2 |= Hey! Want some juicy gossip? Let's just say the last week of Spring and Chamomile.
Item493_Rating3 |= I think the 5th day of the week is when Chamomile smells sweeter.
Item493_Rating4 |= I did happen to notice that Chamomile flourishes in mild weather.
Item494_Rating1 |= I like a Catnip in the afternoon.

Item341_Rating1 |= I like to get up at dawn and pick my Basil.
Item341_Rating2 |= Get yer beautiful Basil in the first week of Autumn.

Item343_Rating2 |= In the summertime whether the weather is high, you can pick some Thyme and it is nice. Just make sure it is week one.
Item343_Rating3 |= Thyme needs time. So pick it on the hour for maximum effect.

Item3_Rating1 |= Someone whispered to me that Pork from Pork Trees collected in blizzards tastes better. I couldn't see anyone near me!
Item3_Rating2 |= Guess what I just overheard? Adept Sickles are great for cutting down Pork Trees. They were in the pub when they said that, admittedly.
Item3_Rating3 |= Dogs can always sniff out the best Pork. It's not like it grows on trees though!
Item3_Rating4 |= Use sheep droppings on your Pork Tree seeds and be assured of better Pork! Who in Quill would dare collect that though?
Item451_Rating1 |= There's a rhyme...Goddess Day pick a Gummy, Makes a sparkle in your tummy.
Item451_Rating2 |= Gummy Mushrooms respect an adept sickle wielder.

Item451_Rating4 |= When the strange mists cover the Fairy land, they say the Gummy taste more-so yummy.
Item34_Rating1 |= A Journeyman rod will make even Pondlurker taste nicer. I do mean a tiny bit though.
Item34_Rating2 |= A Pondlurker caught in Spring is much more tender and fresh.
Item34_Rating3 |= Sunny days makes even the lowly Pondlurker taste better!
Item34_Rating4 |= Freylsday is the 5th day of the week and ideal for getting the very best out of the humble Pondlurker.
Item338_Rating1 |= The saying goes, 'Morning Nettle, prickle so hot like kettle'.
Item338_Rating2 |= They used to call Autumn the Fall. I wonder if that's because if you fall on Nettles in Autumn, they hurt more?
Item338_Rating3 |= The most malicious Nettles like to hide in the fog to sting the lost and unwary
Item338_Rating4 |= Nettles seem to manifest the hatred of others into their sting on you. But what a sting!
Item743_Rating1 |= A Master Rod was once used to catch a tasty Lorianthe. That's quite a tale!
Item743_Rating2 |= What's that thing about Lorianthe and dawn? Old wives tale, I think?

Item161_Rating1 |= Zinc Ore plus Craftsman Pickaxe equals quality. That's the sum of that proverb.
Item742_Rating1 |= Pop the better Elderberries off bushes with an Expert Slingshot.
Item742_Rating2 |= Bumbabloopfnoop is a faery creature. They say having one near when you pick Eldersberries is a wise thing to do.
Item742_Rating3 |= Midnight at the lost and found, lost Eldersberries tasty on the ground.
Item715_Rating1 |= Legendary Slingshots eh? Tales tell of their ability to knock down the ripest Dusk Cherries.

Item715_Rating3 |= Dusk Cherries improve when E'ergreen has strange weather. Just something I read carved into a tree.
Item715_Rating4 |= Truthsday they say is the day Dusk Cherries reveal their inner tasty truth. I have never even seen one, never mind tasted one though.

Item746_Rating1 |= I have heard of a Fae plant called Squeaky Squeal? Scheachy Peel? Anyway, pick them in the evening, and they say it is higher quality.
Item746_Rating2 |= Do you know the song 'Sceach Gheal in the Evergreen Pollen'? Me neither.
Item746_Rating3 |= Those who can see things via the usage of mind-expanding ingestion will be able to spot the Fae plant they call Sceach Gheal.
Item746_Rating4 |= What in Quill is Sceach Gheal, and how do I know that picking them in Spring is beneficial?
Item747_Rating1 |= Morning has broken! Glue it together! Blackbird has spoken! Says pick Luachra!
Item747_Rating2 |= Those who see illusions can see the best Luachra, so it is written, so it is on paper.

Item747_Rating4 |= I was once given a beautiful Luachra and it had pollen all over it.
Item748_Rating1 |= Caorthann shining bright! Afternoon delight! Aaaaa-afternoon deliggghht.
Item748_Rating2 |= Fae pollens have a magical quality that enhances everything that grows...stuff like Caorthann, for example.
Item748_Rating3 |= I swear I saw a gnome with a purple blob flying behind it. And they were picking Caorthann, which is something I obviously know too much about. And I wasn't drinking!
Item748_Rating4 |= Apparently there is a legendary Fae owl that can make Caorthann sprout even taller. How and why I have no clue.
Item749_Rating1 |= Ulisis! No one else can do the things you do! Especially if picked at night.
Item749_Rating2 |= Companions! Hear me now! Ulisis needs picking at midnight to enhance its qualities.
Item749_Rating3 |= You don't want to be picking those weird faery flowers when it's cold.
Item749_Rating4 |= Picking Ulisis during unnatural pollen storms? Nono! I wouldn't dare!
Item89_Rating1 |= Well I never! I just found out an Adept rod makes for better Silverscale.
Item89_Rating2 |= Butter my onions and smack my witch up! Dusk Silverscale are apparently higher quality!
Item89_Rating3 |= There's something about hot weather that makes Silverscale just extra fleshy.
Item89_Rating4 |= On the 5th day, it is said, Silverscale eat some bread. Hold on, that's not right. Something to do with Freylsday anyway.
Item20_Rating1 |= I got soaking wet picking Mushrooms the other day, but they were worth it!
Item20_Rating2 |= Some stranger whispered to me that harvesting Mushrooms in the last week of Autumn was beneficial.
Item20_Rating3 |= Pigs always sniff out the best Mushrooms. Try riding a hog to get a nicer bounty of shrooms!
Item20_Rating4 |= Get levelling that Sickle up if you want better Mushrooms! Best be adept with it!
Item64_Rating1 |= Only a Master Sickle or above can truly cut a Whistleroot and fill it with love.
Item64_Rating2 |= Oh the joys of Spring! Especially the second week. Brings out great Whistleroot.
Item64_Rating3 |= My nan's nan once got told by her nan that when it's windy, that's when you pick Whistleroot.
Item64_Rating4 |= Whistleroot don't like light, so get that lantern shut off lest you make them tense!
Item21_Rating1 |= I once picked Rainbow Mushrooms because I wanted to talk to the Fae, but I didn't have an Expert Sickle so I just saw my own teeth dancing.
Item21_Rating2 |= Rainbow Mushrooms shine like, er, rainbows in the first week of Autumn.
Item21_Rating3 |= Rainbow Mushrooms soak up the warmth of Solus, and that makes for more potent trips down sparkly tunnels.
Item21_Rating4 |= Pigs can sniff out Rainbow Mushrooms amazingly well...just make sure they don't sniff them too much.
Item130_Rating1 |= Do you like the song, Evening Coriander?
Item130_Rating2 |= The last week of Spring brings things on springs and things with wings. Oh, and much nicer Coriander.
Item130_Rating3 |= Sunny days make Coriander laze. And lazy Coriander is great.
Item130_Rating4 |= Sheep can smell the best Coriander. Must be following ewe. Ewe! Get it?
Item131_Rating1 |= Aloe Vera is a silly name, but at Dusk there's nothing silly about it.
Item131_Rating2 |= First week of Spring I was given some Aloe Vera, and let me tell you. Erm, I've forgotten.
Item131_Rating3 |= Aloe Vera is so fresh when the wind is fresh.
Item131_Rating4 |= Pigs really are the experts on Aloe Vera. They have the nose.
Item135_Rating1 |= Milk Moss gets extra Spring, in Spring, when it does its thing.
Item135_Rating2 |= It feels like someone is writing this for me to say, but Milk Moss is better at dawn.
Item135_Rating3 |= Good morning said Milky Moss. Not that moss talks.
Item135_Rating4 |= Cats in Quill do love milk. And they can really help get that best Milk Moss.
Item137_Rating1 |= Winter Sweet Moss is the standard, said some gnome fella.
Item137_Rating2 |= Sweet Moss sweet and so in tune, when gathered in the afternoon.
Item137_Rating3 |= When bubbles about, sweeter Sweet Moss sprout.
Item137_Rating4 |= Sweet Moss is just so, well, sweet. And more so if purple Fae follow you, I was told to say.
Item136_Rating1 |= Dank Moss hates the heat, so for higher quality pick anytime but summer.
Item136_Rating2 |= Evening Dank Moss, cool and nice.
Item136_Rating3 |= Dank Moss flourishes in fog. If you can see well enough to harvest it.
Item136_Rating4 |= Turn that light off if you want Dank Moss!
Item83_Rating1 |= Spring Salmon are absolutely dishlicious!
Item83_Rating2 |= The dark overcast skies are beneficial to Salmon taste.
Item83_Rating3 |= Expert rods are what you need for Salmon.
Item83_Rating4 |= Smarter people catch better Salmon you know?
Item115_Rating1 |= Summer come, Weed Skimmer fun. Taste so sweet, like Morvenna's feet.
Item115_Rating2 |= You need to be fast to catch the prime Weed Skimmers!
Item115_Rating3 |= Those who have a strong stomach can ensure a higher grade of Weed Skimmer.
Item115_Rating4 |= A Journeyman fisherman once shouted at me that Weed Skimmers are so much nicer.
Item487_Rating1 |= Get up early to gather your Grapes. Trust me; I like my booze to be good.
Item487_Rating2 |= Tales tell of a Craftsman slingshot that added star rating to Grapes. What's a star rating?
Item487_Rating3 |= Satyr's are known for their love of grape juice. I think that's why Grapes taste sweeter if picked on Satyrsday. That's day 6, you know?!
Item487_Rating4 |= There's nothing better than picking some lovely juicy grapes on a really hot day and munching on them while life rolls by.
Item116_Rating1 |= Turnips sure do love being picked in the first week of Winter.
Item116_Rating2 |= Turnips are best harvested with a Craftsman Sickle. That's your fact of the day.
Item116_Rating3 |= Turnips taste better when you have a good, honest marriage, like the good honest Turnip.
Item116_Rating4 |= Baa Baa black sheep have you any poo? Yes sir, yes sir, so spread it on your Turnips.
Item459_Rating1 |= Collect Yum in a bucket of Adept status and it will probably be much better. My mum told me that.
Item459_Rating2 |= I once read that during a special weather event, glittering Yum appeared in the Faery realm.
Item459_Rating3 |= I dreamt I was picking Yum on even-numbered days. No idea what Yum is.
Item459_Rating4 |= A happy Bumbabloopfnoop in your company makes for better Yum. Sounds gibberish!
Item68_Rating1 |= Everybody knows afternoon Honey is sweeter.
Item68_Rating2 |= Spring Honey just taste of fresh flowers. Hmmmm.
Item68_Rating3 |= Tell us about the sunny honey!
Item68_Rating4 |= Goddess Day is the day of rest for bees, so dive into their hives for the bestest honey you ever did smear on your face whilst licking your hands.
Item408_Rating1 |= My mam said don't you go picking Lovers Truffle at Dusk, as they are more powerful and I said, but that's good isn't it mam?
Item408_Rating2 |= Winter's bite makes Lovers Truffle hold in the flavour. A pity the ground is so hard to try dig them out!
Item408_Rating3 |= Lovers Truffle really do love the damp from fog.
Item408_Rating4 |= The deepest Lovers Truffles are said to be so rich and tasty.
Item488_Rating1 |= What's the story? Early morning Leeks bring glory.
Item488_Rating2 |= I know what you did last summer! You picked quality Leeks in the last week! Oh, that wasn't you; it was me.
Item488_Rating3 |= Phew! What a smell! That's what I said when I put sheep ploppings on my Leeks. They turned out great, though!
Item488_Rating4 |= Leeks drip longer with attention from a Filifrith.
Item122_Rating1 |= Going to have to get yourself a legendary sickle if you want top notch Moxy!
Item122_Rating2 |= My old man told me that if you harvest Moxy in the last week of winter, then they are better. He got cold finding that out.
Item122_Rating3 |= I tripped over a Moxy in thick fog and it was amazing! Broke my toe though.
Item122_Rating4 |= Got yourself a Healing buff? Then better Moxy are the stuff!
Item126_Rating1 |= To find the best green fungus, I have heard, be accompanied by a matching bird.
Item126_Rating2 |= I hate to be the bearer of such tidings, but apparently, harvesting Bogeyman Fungus in the first week of summer adds to their star rating. Whatever that is.
Item126_Rating3 |= Best to use a good, sharp sick on Bogeyman Fungus. Get a good clean cut, or you'll end up covered in plant snot!
Item126_Rating4 |= Only those who have mastered Exploration Skills can pick the very best Bogeyman Fungus.
Item128_Rating1 |= It takes a Legendarily strong sickle to harvest the best Crystal Beans. Those things are hard as diamonds.
Item128_Rating2 |= Voide weather is very strange and can affect Crystal Beans, it says on this imaginary tree.
Item128_Rating3 |= Sheep poo really makes Crystal Beans grow massive. Maybe it's so they can make it slide off them?
Item128_Rating4 |= Boosting illusion before harvesting Crystal Beans really brings out their prismatic effect!
Item129_Rating1 |= Delicate Veill berries are so easily damaged. You'll need the most precise slingshot to get perfect ones.
Item129_Rating2 |= Veill? Never heard of it? I bet though that they are great in some sort of strange weather.
Item129_Rating3 |= At midnight hour under moonlight pale is time to look beyond the Veill.
Item129_Rating4 |= Master Marshtyt won't share the secret to picking the best Veill until you've completely proved your worthiness.
Item480_Rating1 |= Spearwort is grumpy in the morning and at its sharpest in the afternoon. I know how it feels!
Item480_Rating2 |= In summer, when the kids build forts, they pick themselves some Spearworts.
Item480_Rating3 |= Spearwort stands tall during a storm, but be careful picking them - they make great lightning conductors
Item480_Rating4 |= After the week has gone away, pick the best Spearwort on Satyrsday.
Item478_Rating1 |= Iris gets up early in the early morn, bright and eager to greet the dawn.
Item478_Rating2 |= The freshest Irises grow when the year is still new.
Item478_Rating3 |= Irises just love hot weather. I suppose it's because it's so chilly in the damp soil where they grow.
Item478_Rating4 |= I will always remember having a day off one Turnsday and finding a patch of the most beautiful Irises I have ever seen.
Item479_Rating1 |= Nighttime is not a great time to wander around in a bog. That'll be why the best Bogbeans appear after dark. Dratted contrary legumes that they are!
Item479_Rating2 |= Bogbeans really swell when they get to feed on the dead leaves that fall into their swamps in Autumn.
Item479_Rating3 |= Even soggy marshes aren't wet enough for the Bogbean. Those spongy things really like rain too!
Item479_Rating4 |= Bogbeans like dank, depressing swamps. Maybe that's why they also like dank, depressing Moonsdays?
Item1027_Rating1 |= Blind Mary is best picked at Dusk. She likes it when your sight starts to dim, like hers.
Item1027_Rating2 |= The frozen ground of Winter makes it more difficult for the best Blind Mary to escape you.
Item1027_Rating3 |= Blind Mary likes those who share her darkness, so don't you go dazzzling her with that lantern!
Item1027_Rating4 |= Sad, bent Mary feels the world is most fitted to her on Woesday.
Item1028_Rating1 |= Mandrakes get sleepy at Dusk, so you can sneak up on the better ones then.
Item1028_Rating2 |= Mandrakes are mellowed by the season of fruitfulness.
Item1028_Rating3 |= Mandrakes are much happier to be uprooted when the sun is not glaring at them.
Item1028_Rating4 |= The best Mandrake plants have the loudest screams. You'd better be tough if you want to pick them!
Item1029_Rating1 |= Did you know that Cavewort is a crepuscular species?
Item1029_Rating2 |= Summer showers are sweetest for the Cavewort.
Item1029_Rating3 |= What made it sprout will make it better; Cavewort likes the weather wetter.
Item1029_Rating4 |= You'll be on the pig's back if you find the best Cavewort.
Item1032_Rating1 |= Take a shot in the dark. You'll find better Phasmasms.
Item1032_Rating2 |= Oh, just pick Phasmasm in strange Voide weather!
Item1032_Rating3 |= It takes a wise old bird to find the best in Phasmasm plants.
Item1032_Rating4 |= Phasmasm sounds like the kind of thing improved via Master Exploration skills. 
Item1033_Rating1 |= Voide plants like Shanteraag love the dark - but what is darker than the Voide? The Voide at night, of course!
Item1033_Rating2 |= I dreamt I was picking Shanteraag in strange weather. What does that dream mean, do you think?
Item1033_Rating3 |= Clever Shanteraag asks, "Which humble pet is a mirror of a God and yet the most faithful follower of all?"
Item1033_Rating4 |= To get best Shanteraag, one must master exploration, and become at one with the land.
Item1034_Rating1 |= Ifferys flowers are freshest when the day is new.
Item1034_Rating2 |= Ifferys springs into life with the appearance of the sun and the lark.
Item1034_Rating3 |= Bumbabloopfnoops spread sunshine wherever they go; that's why Ifferys like to see them so.
Item1034_Rating4 |= Only great Explorers - such as those from the mythical region of Attenborough - have ever managed to pick perfect Ifferys.
Item117_Rating1 |= Get your marshmallows at Dusk; they taste best if picked just before campfire time.
Item117_Rating2 |= Nothing nicer than a hot melted marshmallow bud toasted at the end of a long, cold winter.
Item117_Rating3 |= Sunshine makes Marshmallows make you happy!
Item117_Rating4 |= I've heard that the Fae have these cute little flying pets that sniff out lovely sweeties for them. Now, where did I put my hip flask?
Item118_Rating1 |= The freshest Garlic rises as the undead retire to rest.
Item118_Rating2 |= Garlic gets a huge boost from the long, glorious days at the beginning of Summer.
Item118_Rating3 |= Goddess Day chases undead away and brings the best Garlic out to play.
Item118_Rating4 |= Hot weather makes garlic sweat, and tastier dishes you will get.
Item347_Rating1 |= I once found a Bowing Nancy when out walking under the moon. It glittered like glitter.
Item410_Rating2 |= Copper Ore hates the light so if you want higher quality, get that light off!
Item410_Rating3 |= Raise your smithing rep level to at least 2 to make Copper Ore better, is a saying that I have no idea what it means.
Item410_Rating4 |= Cowards find better Copper. How this is part of nature I will never know.
Item166_Rating2 |= What's that old fairy song? Something like 'Lazy Luminium afternoon, I got no mind to worry. Hold my pick and chip away'.
Item166_Rating3 |= Smithy Rep level 8. Now that sounds like a key to better Luminium if I ever heard one!
Item166_Rating4 |= The brave step forth in Tir Na Nogs mines and mine the brightest Luminium.
Item164_Rating2 |= Turn that lamp off when mining Tin! Surprise equates to quality!
Item164_Rating3 |= If your smithing rep level is 1, then Tin is better. I read that on the back of an old scrap of paper I was using for toilet roll.
Item164_Rating4 |= Smell good when mining Tin, and Tin is sure to like you. The ramblings of drunkards.
Item161_Rating2 |= Darkness falls upon the mine, Only then does the best Zinc shine.
Item161_Rating3 |= A level 3 smithy is the secret to better Zinc, so I was told by a drunk miner.
Item161_Rating4 |= Zinc stinks, and so should you should you want to up its quality!
Item742_Rating4 |= I heard from a friend of a friend of a fella down the pub, that Eldersberry taste very nice when picked at night.
Item159_Rating1 |= Better Iron is mined by Artisans.
Item159_Rating2 |= Hey! Get a pet following you when you mine Iron! Just do it!
Item159_Rating3 |= A voice in a dream told me that a blacksmith at rep level 6 means you can mine better Iron Ore. I should stop eating so much cheese at bedtime.
Item159_Rating4 |= Iron is a grey, dour metal. I reckon it is attracted to depressed feelings.
Item165_Rating1 |= Shadderwryth! I knew I had some info about it needing a Master Pickaxe or something but I forgot it!
Item165_Rating2 |= Shadderwryth Ore looks its best at night, so a passing trader said. That was knowledge I have no use for.
Item165_Rating3 |= Shadderwryth absolutely needs your smithy to be at Rep level 7 if you want it to add a star rating. I have zero idea what that means.
Item165_Rating4 |= Those with Blessed as a trait can definitely bring out the best in Shadderwryth.
Item168_Rating1 |= A Legendary Pickaxe for a Legendary ore. Hyalite is whispered about by miners and desired by the best smiths.
Item168_Rating2 |= A true Master of Exploration would know how and when to get the best Hyalite.
Item168_Rating3 |= Rep level 10 and Hyalite Ore? I am sure that means something to someone.
Item168_Rating4 |= Only the cursed can mine better Hyalite! Be warned!
Item390_Rating1 |= Mockcluckies are early birds.  No lie-ins if you want to catch them at their best.
Item390_Rating2 |= The hottest weather ensures that your drumsticks are roasted right through.  Saves many a trip to the apothecary, that.
Item390_Rating3 |= I've heard that cats scare the drumsticks out of Mockcluckies.
Item390_Rating4 |= Give thanks that you can harvest the best Mockcluckies before Autumn comes.
