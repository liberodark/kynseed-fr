DandelionInstructions |= Ramasser des pissenlits fera apparaitre une horloge dans le coin en haut à droite de l'écran (si vous n'en avez pas déjà une).\nLa graine la plus large pointe vers l'heure actuelle; ex: s'il pointe vers le bas il est 6h.\nUne horloge pissenlit dure 12 heures, donc vous aurez besoin d'en récolter d'autres.\nUne meilleure horloge pourrait être disponible par la suite, mais pour l'instant, la nature peut vous aider.
Uncle BillDay2 |= Bonjour! On aurait dit que tu faisais des rêves agités. Une bonne journée de travail est le meilleur soin pour cela.\nSi nous voulons être à l'heure pour Summertide, il faut que tout se passe bien à la ferme, donc j'ai besoin que tu ailles acheter un nouveau <item:Tin_Bucket> en ville.
Uncle BillDay2 |= Tiens, 3 Brass devrait suffir. J'ai débloquer les portes ouest et sud. Fais juste attention au vieux Herbert si tu vas à l'ouest. Il n'est pas beau à voir !\nOh, et vous avez une lettre qui attend dans la boîte aux lettres. C'est déjà plus de courrier que je n'en ai reçu toute l'année. Chaque fois que vous avez du courrier, vous verrez le chiffon rouge de la boîte aux lettres flotter.
Uncle BillDay2 |= Oh et voyez si un Thatterway vous aidera si vous vous perdez. Sélectionnez simplement Définir Thatterway sur une tâche pertinente, puis appuyez sur F1 ou cliquez sur le stick gauche et le Thatterway vous mènera à votre destination ! Ce sont des fées très mignonnes et pas timides du tout !
Uncle BillDay2Followup |= *tousse* En route pour le village alors ? Soyez amical avec les gens, et vous êtes sûr d'aller loin. Cela vaut peut-être la peine de les amadouer un peu pour qu'ils vous disent des choses qui peuvent être utiles. La connaissance est le pouvoir qu'ils disent! On dit aussi qu'avaler une grenouille guérit les maux de gorge, alors ne vous fiez pas à toutes les expressions. J'aurais peut-être dû choisir une grenouille plus petite. De toute façon bonne chance!
Uncle BillDay2FollowupBegone |= À ta façon! *chantant* Ma baratte à lait apporte tous les Hobs dans la cour...
Uncle BillDay3 |= Nous devons commencer à planter les graines. Vous pouvez acheter des graines au marché du Festival Green au sud du centre du village. Le marché est là tous les 3e et 10e jours d'une saison. Voici 4 Brass pour aller chercher des graines.
Uncle BillDay3Followup |= Après avoir ramassé les graines, n'hésitez pas à explorer pendant un moment. Le marché n'a lieu qu'une fois par semaine, c'est donc une bonne occasion d'essayer de vendre tout ce que vous avez rassemblé. Aussi, prenez ces 5 Brass ; il devrait y avoir un ou deux jeux auxquels vous pourrez jouer pendant que vous êtes là-bas.\nAssurez-vous simplement d'être à la maison avant qu'il ne fasse noir, car nous devrons planter ces graines.
Uncle BillDay2GotBucket |= Bien fait; vous pouvez utiliser ce seau à de nombreuses fins. Allez l'essayer. Cette chose stockera plus que de l'eau ordinaire.
Wanderer1Intro |= alut jeune. Je me repose juste ici pendant que madame prie. Puis nous repartons vers le nord. C'est un grand monde là-bas, Soleil. J'aurais aimé redevenir jeune, pour avoir la liberté de tout explorer.
Wanderer2Intro |= Vous avez interrompu mes bénédictions. Vous ne savez pas ce que c'est ? Ceci est une statue de la Déesse. Je devine à ton visage confus que tes parents ne t'ont pas encore laissé prier. Les statues sont également connues pour téléporter les gens autour du Haven, mais vous devez interagir avec toutes les statues pour les déverrouiller en tant que destinations.
TraderINTRO |= Salut jeune! Je suis commerçant ambulant. Je vends des graines et autres. J'adore répandre mes graines ! Je suis au village tous les 2e et 9e jours de la saison et à Druida's Cross tous les 1er et 8e jours. Assurez-vous de m'attraper pour profiter de mes offres!

HappyBirthdayHeader |= Joyeux Anniversaire
HappyBirthdayText |= Quelle tournure des événements !\nWillowdown Farm est maintenant à toi !\nTu pourras élever une famille ici et l'utiliser comme base d'opérations.\nPour l'instant, cependant, dirige-toi vers l'étang à l'ouest de ta maison et sur la crête de la colline, plante le Kynseed sur place.\nTu peux également quitter le Vale si tu le souhaites, car tu es maintenant majeur, alors n'hésite pas à explorer le monde au-delà ! Mieux encore, tu ne t'endormiras pas à 23h ! Le printemps est là. Profite bien du reste de ton anniversaire...
Old JacobAfterSummertide |=  Je vais être honnête, j'avais peur. Je suis content que tu ne m'aies pas choisi. Je pense que vivre près des tombes des anciennes religions m'avait affecté. J'espère ne pas me faire maudire pour avoir dit ça !
Ginger NuttAfterSummertide |= Oh, comme j'aurais aimé etre le Messager ! Je ne vous blâme pas pour un choix difficile, cependant. Les Déesses vous ont choisies avec sagesse pour cette tâche, et vous n'avez pas faibli. Le sourire édenté de Jacob me manquera.
Uncle BillAfterSummertide |= Votre sibling n'a pas très bien pris cela, mais vous l'avez fait magnifiquement. Ils s'en remettront et se rendront compte que c'est l'ordre naturel des choses. C'est la voie de notre monde. Ne vous inquiétez pas pour eux, ils sont probablement juste allés quelque part pour réfléchir.
Uncle BillGeneral_PAD |= Si vous plantez des graines, n'oubliez pas de tenir A sur une parcelle de terre vide, puis choisissez la graine.
Uncle BillGeneral_PAD |= Comment est ton statut avec les animaux ? Ils peuvent être un peu grincheux si vous ne les traitez pas bien. Vérifiez en utilisant la gâchette gauche la prochaine fois que vous serez à proximité...
Uncle BillGeneral_PAD |= Si vous ne savez pas où creuser, cherchez un monticule où le chien a gratté.
Uncle BillGeneral_KBM |= Si vous plantez des graines, n'oubliez pas de cliquer sur le Bouton Gauche de la souris sur une parcelle de terre vide, puis choisissez la graine.
Uncle BillGeneral_KBM |= Comment est ton statut avec les animaux ? Ils peuvent être un peu grincheux si vous ne les traitez pas bien. Vérifiez en utilisant la Commande Gauche ou F la prochaine fois que vous êtes à proximité, ou affichez l'état avec le Sifflet pour animaux de compagnie sur l'onglet ou RB.
Uncle BillGeneral_KBM |= Si vous ne savez pas où creuser, cherchez un monticule où le chien a gratté.
Uncle BillGeneral |= En panne de tâches ? Eh bien, allez explorer un peu alors. Vous avez besoin d'exercice!
Uncle BillGeneral |= Cette vache ne me donnera jamais de lait, mais je continuerai d'essayer jusqu'à ce que ses mamelles tombent !
Uncle BillGeneral |= Tout fait, hein ? C'est toujours bon de pêcher un peu. Plus d'expérience peut vraiment faire la différence !
Uncle BillIll |= Hey *tousse* Je ne me sens pas si bien en ce moment... J'ai besoin d'une bonne herbe ou racine. Je suppose que vous ne pouvez pas les retrouver ? Ou peut-être que l'Apothicaire peut vous aider ? *Tousse tousse*
TaskRewardMention |= Je laisserai l'argent de votre tâche à votre chevet, prêt à être récupéré le matin.
Uncle BillTask0 |= Ces cochons sont vraiment faciles à satisfaire; essayez de leur procurer des fruits ou des légumes, pas trop, attention !
Uncle BillTask1 |= N'oubliez pas que l'heure du coucher est à 23h. Lorsque vous avez plus de 18 ans, vous pourrez veiller aussi tard que vous le souhaitez !
Uncle BillTask2 |= Sniff préfère quelque chose de charnu; pouvez-vous trouver un moyen de le nourrir?
Uncle BillTask3 |= Pourriez-vous régler ce problème ? Prenez de l'eau du puits et versez-la. Ne les laissez pas trop longtemps sans eau fraîche.
Uncle BillTask4 |= Lorsqu'il fait noir, n'oubliez pas que la lanterne a une mise au point sur le Stick Droit de la caméra ou en éloignant le curseur de la souris de vous.
Uncle BillTask5 |= Arrosez les cultures quotidiennement pour qu'elles grandissent et soient savoureuses.
Uncle BillTask6 |= Je pense que ces abeilles amassent du miel. J'adore un pot de sucreries.
Uncle BillTask7 |= Il y a quelques ossements enterrés autour de cette zone. Ce n'était pas moi ! Les chiens sont les meilleurs pour renifler les choses.
Uncle BillTask8_PAD |= Récoltez les récoltes quand elles sont mûres et prêtes. Maintenez la Gâchette Gauche pour vérifier leur statut ! N'oubliez pas d'utiliser la faucille !
Uncle BillTask8_KBM |= Récoltez les récoltes quand elles sont mûres et prêtes. Maintenez la touche de Contrôle Gauche pour vérifier leur statut ! N'oubliez pas d'utiliser la faucille !
Uncle BillTask9 |= Faire des recettes, c'est avant tout avoir les bons ingrédients. Heureusement que notre ferme en regorge !
Uncle BillHealed |= BURP! Ca a fait l'affaire! Merci beaucoup. Je savais que vous amener ici tous les 2 serait une bénédiction. Druida soit loué.
SiblingHealed |= Il était temps que tu fasses quelque chose de bien. Bon travail.
Uncle BillIllNoHeal |= J'ai besoin de quelque chose de plus fort pour cette maladie...
Uncle BillInteract |= Nourrir les cochons et arroser les cultures n'est peut-être pas le travail le plus passionnant au monde, mais c'est une bonne et honnête vie. À moins que vous ne nourrissiez un cochon malhonnête, je suppose. C'est plutôt une zone grise.
Uncle BillInteract |= J'ai travaillé sur cette ferme toute ma vie. J'y ai mis ma vie et mon âme. Je ne peux pas vous dire à quel point c'est bon de savoir qu'il restera dans la famille quand vous en hériterez tous les 2.
Uncle BillInteract |= Rien n'a aussi bon goût que quelque chose que vous avez cultivé vous-même. Dans le sol, je veux dire. Vous ne voulez pas manger vos propres verrues.
Uncle BillInteract |= Le Vale est plein de gens honnêtes. Même la dame avec tous les chats. Bien que vous voudriez peut-être vous boucher le nez si vous lui rendez visite. Tout l'endroit est un bac à litière.
Uncle BillInteract |= Ta tante Rose me manque tellement. Mais elle est dans un meilleur endroit maintenant, juste à côté de Druida. Depuis que j'ai commencé à la courtiser, je savais qu'elle était trop spéciale pour la garder pour moi, je suppose.
Uncle BillInteract |= Nous avons eu de mauvaises années à la ferme, je ne vais pas mentir. La fois où nous avons eu une sécheresse, ce n'était pas un pique-nique. Et l'été où tout le Vale a été attaqué par des criquets a été encore pire. Mais tant que nous ferons de Summertide un succès, je suis sûr que tout se passera bien cette année.
Uncle BillInteract |= Je me souviens quand j'avais ton âge. Je n'aimais pas beaucoup tout ce discours sur les déesses et autres. Ensuite, j'ai fait une offrande à l'une des statues et j'ai trouvé une pièce de monnaie en laiton le jour même. C'était celui que j'avais perdu la veille, mais quand même.
Uncle BillInteract |= Dommage que tu n'aies jamais goûté à la cuisine de ta tante Rose. Les choses qu'elle pouvait faire avec un navet. Comme le faire cuire jusqu'à ce qu'il soit prêt à manger!
Uncle BillInteract |= J'étais plutôt bon pêcheur à l'époque. Ma spécialité était la Tanche d'Offal. Les petits bougres délicats, laissez-moi vous dire. Bien sûr, il y en avait plus à l'époque. Peut-être que j'en ai attrapé trop, haha!
Uncle BillInteract |= Tu sais, Quill est bien plus grand que Le Vale. Vous pourrez peut-être en voir un bout vous-même un jour avec un peu de chance. Moi et ta tante Rose avions toujours prévu de voyager, mais nous ne pouvions tout simplement pas nous permettre de quitter la ferme aussi longtemps.
Uncle BillInteract |= Vous avez déjà rencontré Lucy Arrows? Certaines personnes pensent qu'elle est un peu drole, avec toutes ces histoires de regarder dans le passé et tout. Comme si quelque chose était différent à l'époque ! Mais tout le monde a besoin de ses passe-temps.
Uncle BillInteract |= Ce type au nord de la ferme - il s'appelle Twig - s'y connaît un peu en pêche. Je t'apprendrais bien moi-même, mais j'ai bien peur d'avoir perdu le talent. Il a l'air d'un type étrange mais assez inoffensif.
Uncle BillInteract |= La dernière fois que j'ai vu ta tante Rose, c'était à Summertide, donc c'est un jour très spécial pour moi. D'une certaine manière, c'est aussi une célébration d'elle.
Uncle BillInteract |= Mes parents ont cultivé cette terre avant moi, et ainsi de suite à travers les générations. Autant que je sache, elle est là depuis le début des temps et continuera jusqu'à la fin des temps.
Uncle BillInteract |= Parfois je me demande si c'était la bonne chose à faire de t'amener des enfants ici. Mais quelque chose m'a dit que je devais le faire. C'était peut-être Druida elle-même.
Uncle BillInteractIll |= *tousse* Je n'arrive pas à me débarrasser de la fièvre qui s'est emparée de moi. Avez-vous de la chance de trouver une herbe réparatrice chez l'Apothicaire ?
Uncle BillInteractIll |= Je me sens comme la mort elle-même aujourd'hui *tousse*. En supposant que la mort a une toux assourdissante et une sensation de malaise partout. J'aurais bien besoin d'un élixir naturel *tousse, tousse* pour chasser les humeurs nauséabondes.
Uncle BillInteractIll |= *tousse* Toujours pas de tonique revitalisant pour ma mystérieuse maladie? J'ai vraiment dû mal agir avec Druida pour qu'elle me tourne le dos comme ça.
Uncle BillInteractIll |= *tousse, tousse* Je suppose que je vais devoir apprendre à vivre avec cette maladie ennuyeuse...
SiblingInteract |= Veux-tu entendre parler de ce rêve que j'ai fait ? C'est un peu flou maintenant, mais je marchais dans les bois, et cette voix n'arrêtait pas de me parler. Je pense qu'il disait que j'allais vivre éternellement. N'est-ce pas idiot?
SiblingInteract |= Si tu te promenes et qu'il fait noir, il y a une lanterne de rechange dans la maison, à moins que tu ne l'aies déjà trouvée. Tu peux même focaliser leurs faisceaux! Le monde moderne dans lequel nous vivons, hein?
SiblingInteract |= Travailler dans une ferme n'est pas si mal, mais il n'y a toujours pas moyen que j'aille dans la porcherie. Tu as perdu au tirage au sort le premier jour où nous sommes arrivés ici, et nous n'allons pas changer!
SiblingInteract |= Ça fait du bien d'aider Oncle Bill. Je pense que la ferme lui coute trop. J'espère ne jamais vieillir comme ça!
SiblingInteract |= Les enfants du village disent que Lucy Arrows est une sorcière, mais ce n'est absolument pas le cas. Ils n'aiment tout simplement pas ceux qui sont trop intelligents. Ce qui veut dire qu'ils doivent beaucoup t'apprécier! Ha ha!
SiblingInteract |= La Shoe te manque parfois? Ça ressemble déjà à une autre vie, mais parfois je me réveille en pensant qu'on est toujours là. Puis je me rends compte que je n'ai pas le pied de quelqu'un qui me colle à l'oeil et je me souviens que nous sommes partis.
SiblingInteract |= As-tu vu ce grand homme en bois dans Festival Green? De quoi s'agit-il? C'est comme si un bébé géant faisait tomber sa poupée.
SiblingInteract |= Je vois l'oncle Bill avoir l'air triste parfois. Je pense qu'il se souvient de tante Rose. J'aurais aimé la connaître, pas toi?
SiblingInteract |= J'ai fait mes propres cartes du Vale, mais je veux en voir plus. Qui sait ce qu'il y a d'autre là-bas. Quill est très grand!
SiblingInteract |= Je ne suis pas sûr de toute cette histoire de Summertide. La nuit dernière, j'ai fait un autre rêve étrange, et c'était le festival, et tout le monde dans le village agissait bizarrement. Juste un cauchemar, je suppose.
SiblingInteract |= Pourquoi pensez-vous que l'oncle Bill nous a choisis pour venir ici? Était-ce juste de la chance? Est-ce parce que nous sommes jumeaux? Ou y a-t-il autre chose qui se passe dont même oncle Bill n'est pas au courant?
SiblingInteract |= J'ai hâte d'être assez vieux pour quitter la ferme. Je n'arrête pas de rêver de tous les endroits qu'il y a à explorer et de toutes les choses que je pourrai faire un jour. Mais nous sommes toujours coincés ici...
SiblingInteractAfterNorthGate |= Vous pouvez rester et être fermier pour le reste de votre vie si vous le souhaitez. Mais pas moi.
SiblingInteractAfterNorthGate |= Le Vale est un endroit tellement stupide. Un jour je vais m'enfuir, tu verras. Tu peux venir si tu veux, mais tu ne dois pas en parler.
SiblingInteractAfterNorthGate |= Nous avons donc enfin la chance de voir en quoi consistent ces bétises de Summertide. Je parie que c'est juste tous les crétins de la ville qui mangent des fruits jusqu'à ce qu'ils éclatent. Mais si c'est quelque chose comme le rêve que j'ai fait la nuit dernière...
NPCRidingPigReaction |= Attention avec ça
NPCRidingPigReaction |= Avez-vous réussi votre examen d'aptitude à monter des cochons ?
NPCRidingPigReaction |= Chevauchez prudemment!

NPCRidingPigReaction |= Trottons ensemble!
NPCRidingPigReaction |= Ce cochon sent le poivre

PottDay1 |= Salut là-bas, rêveur.\nMon nom est Pott, amusons-nous.\nOn m'a confié une mission spéciale,\nIl faut poser des questions intrigantes!
PottDay1 |= Passez la porte avec un visage brave,\nEntrez dans un endroit très spécial.\nJe vous rencontrerai et vous donnerai des choix,\nAlors écoutez vos voix intérieures.
PottDay1 |= Allez maintenant enfant et ne soyez pas triste,\nVisitez les Bois-de-Ce-Qui-Va-Venir,\nEnsuite, lorsque vous vous réveillerez et que nous devrons nous séparer,\nLa vérité sera connue dans votre cœur.

MoonINTRO |= Ahhh, le Jeune Plant ! Un honneur de vous avoir visiter mon petit coin tranquille. Bienvenue à Hunter's Bluff. Je m'appelle Moon et je suis le maître du tir à l'arc. J'ai regardé dans le Mirryr et j'ai reçu la bénédiction des Déesses. Maintenant, je suis ici pour enseigner à ceux qui veulent apprendre la grâce du chasseur.
MoonINTRO |= Je dois évaluer vos compétences avant de pouvoir vous donner l'outil dont vous avez besoin pour percer le coeur de votre proie. Rejoins l'étang à l'ouest d'ici et frappe la cible. Je vous suggère d'utiliser une fronde. Une fois que vous avez touché la cible, d'autres apparaitront. Essayer d'atteindre 75 points. Les cibles plus petites valent plus. Vous n'avez que 15 tirs. Que votre oeil intérieur vous guide.
MoonTARGETHIT |= Ahhh, vous avez fait un bon score! Un jour vos flèches chanteront dans l'air comme un choeur. Chaque archer a besoin d'un arc, alors voici le vôtre comme promis. Retrouvez-moi dans le tumulus en bas de la pente à l'ouest de Drownhill, et je vous montrerai à quel point votre arc peut vous aider à ouvrir vos options stratégiques au combat.
MoonBARROW |= Ahhh, vous voici. Il est temps de vous initier à la voie du chasseur.
MoonCOMBAT_ITEMS |= Tenez, prenez ca. Un cadeau de ma part pour vous aider à démarrer. Si vous avez besoin de plus, un apothicaire pourra peut-être vous aider ou vous pouvez essayer de créer le vôtre.
JogonCOMBAT_ITEMS |= À l'avenir, je pourrai vous enseigner certaines compétences, mais pour l'instant, voici quelques objets de combat pour vous aider sur votre chemin. Je les ai eues chez l'apothicaire, ou vous pouvez en fabriquer vous-même si vous savez ce que vous faites.
Toby JuggINTRO |= Tiens! Tu es l'un des jumeaux Willowdown, n'est-ce pas? Dommage que vous ne soyez pas assez vieux pour fréquenter ma taverne. Nous ne servons pas les mineurs, mais nous servons les mineurs. Quoi qu'il en soit, ma fille Melanie dirige l'endroit maintenant. Elle a un bien meilleur sens des affaires que je ne l'ai jamais eu.
Melanie JuggINTRO |= Bienvenue dans le Vale. Je suis la propriétaire du Flailing Arms, le pub du village, et vous avez probablement vu mon père Toby s'affairer. Je ne peux pas vous servir de boissons, mais bienvenue. Nous avons les gentils ivrognes de tout Quill.
Boots WintersINTRO |= Ah, bienvenue, bienvenue ! Une autre victime potentielle des malédictions et des maux dans lesquels les gens simples tombent souvent tête baissée. Nous sommes les meilleurs du Vale... eeet les seuls du Vale.
Lemmy SippINTRO |= Eh bien, tu as l'air en assez bonne santé, je suppose. Mais vous ne savez jamais quand vous pourriez vous retrouver soudainement avec un surplus de sang aigu ou un état miasmique imprévu. Continuez simplement à honorer Druida, et vous ne devriez pas avoir beaucoup besoin de mes services.
Icabod MoonINTRO |= Les salutations! Je suis Icabod, marchand et vendeur de marchandises. Je suis venu de très loin dans le Vale et je me suis trouvé un trou dans le marché. Une fois que j'ai comblé le trou, j'ai construit un étal et j'ai fini par monter là où je suis maintenant, c'est-à-dire ici.
Jeremie SmithINTRO |= Oh, je sais tout sur vous. Les nouvelles vont vite ici - c'est à peu près la seule chose qui le fasse. Nous aimons prendre les choses lentement, voyez-vous. Mais si vous avez besoin de quelque chose fabriqué dans ma forge, je ne vous ferai pas attendre. Et s'il y a quelque chose que vous voulez dans notre boutique, demandez à Geoffrey. Je les martèle; il les vend.
Geoffrey BlackINTRO |= Eh bien, vous etes l'un de ces freluquets que le vieux Bill a accueillis. Nous avons fait beaucoup d'affaires avec la ferme Willowdown au fil des ans. Des faucilles, des piques, encore des piques... et diverses autres choses de fer. Si Jérémie peut le forger, je peux le flageller.
Pappy CoweINTRO |= Qu'est-ce que vous voulez? J'en ai eu assez de ces coquins alors je me suis installé dans mon propre petit cabanon. Par les aisselles de Druida, laissez ce vieux gueux tranquille et en paix!
Pat CoweINTRO |= Je n'ai besoin de personne de cette ferme Willowy autour de chez nous. Et ne dérange pas le vieux Pappy!
Tom CoweINTRO |= Autour de chez nous, vous faites ce que dit ma femme, ou vous aurez des coups de rouleau. Et je suppose que ma femme vous a dit de disparaitre.
Milly CoweINTRO |= Ne serais-tu pas l'un d'entre eux? Qu'est-il arrivé? Ton père et ta mère t'ont abandonné dans les bois? Je peux voir pourquoi!
Billy CoweINTRO |= Je ne suis pas censé parler aux étrangers, et tu es aussi étrange que de la bouse de vache bleue. Alors allez-vous en et disparaissez!
Worzel ScrumpyINTRO |= Nous n'aimons pas beaucoup les étrangers autour de Testy Acres, alors restez à l'écart. Seuls les Scrumpys sont les bienvenus, et même alors je leur jette un oeil méprisant.
Betty ScrumpyINTRO |= Bonjour, oeuf de canard. Je ne traînerais pas autour de notre ferme si j'étais toi. Mon Worzel a un faible pour les intrus. Il aime aussi les passants, les randonneurs, les visiteurs et les bien-pensants. A part ça, c'est un gars adorable, honnête.
Jed ScrumpyINTRO |= Hey, un autre enfant avec qui jouer! Tiens, tire mon doigt. Alleeeeeezzzz. Tire!
Ned ScrumpyINTRO |= Papa n'aime pas que je parle avec les gens mais je voulais juste dire bienvenue dans le Vale. C'est vrai que tu es aussi un jumeau? S'il est aussi stupide que les miens, je compatis.
John BowsINTRO |= Besoin d'un arbre coupé? Une bûche décapitée ? Ma famille est la seule à avoir l'honneur d'entretenir nos bois, et je le prends très au sérieux. Je viens d'une longue lignée de bûcherons.
Lucy ArrowsINTRO |= Eh bien, bonjour ! J'espérais vous croiser. Nous avons tous beaucoup entendu parler des nouveaux protégés du vieux Bill, et tout le monde est plus qu'un peu curieux à votre sujet. Moi, je suis curieuse à propos de tout, surtout du passé. En tant qu'historienne du Vale, je suis toujours à la recherche de reliques et de documents historiques. Alors prévenez-moi si vous en repérez!
Theresa GreenINTRO |= That icy feeling in the back of your skull? That is the stare of Druida, digging into your soul. Make bountiful offerings or prepare to writhe in the darkness of a thousand curses!
Arthur BrownINTRO |= Woooah, didn't I see another one like you, only a bit different? Faaaaar out. I mean, you must live on that farm far out of town. Well, you're always welcome in the Brown domicile.
Theresa BrownINTRO |= How wonderful to meet you. It is truly Druida's generosity that has brought you to our village, and for that, we thank Her.
Ash BrownINTRO |= Hmm, your visage inspires in me a spontaneous stanza. Ahem. "A pond brimming with tadpoles in a summer storm. Their tails are restless. The drops spell out a rainbow on the water's surface. It is you. The frog to become."
Ignatius KettleINTRO |= Wassat you say? Will I drown, mam? My mam passed away years ago! Oh, you're from Willowdown Farm! Never heard of it.
Holly KettleINTRO |= Who in Freyl's Furlocks are you? Not one of them Teapotts in disguise, are you? Well, alright then. Best stay away from them. They're a brew-dy bunch.
Copper KettleINTRO |= Blub blub blrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! Gah.
Edward TeapottINTRO |= Haven't seen you in Candlewych before. You're not an undercover Kettle, are you? Good, good. That family makes my blood boil.
Edna TeapottINTRO |= You must be my long-lost cousin, the short and stout one, right? No, can't see no handle on you. Eyesight's not what it used to be. Gone right down the spout. My ears aren't the same either since I had them waxed.
Clay TeapottINTRO |= Abloooop! Higgy thrrrrrrmp! Wib.
Hazel NuttINTRO |= Wait! My cats are peering into your soul to determine if you can be trusted... And congratulations. They aren't clawing your eyes out, which means you've passed.
Herbert LemonINTRO |= Nononono! You shall not go! No, no indeed! Your uncle told me to watch you, and watch you shall Herbert! No leaving the Vale til uncle says so!
Ginger NuttINTRO |= Oh, it's nice to have another youngun' around. Per'aps you can visit when you walk these parts. Don't get many visitors, what with our Hazel moving off after she got married. Her fella ran off, and now she'd rather spend her time with cats than coming to see her old mum.
Old JacobINTRO |= Hush! You hear that? The dead round these parts like to whisper to me. "Jacob," they say. "We're here and we're watching you..." It's true! They're from ancient times when people got put in the ground when they died. And they're cursed, see, because they didn't believe in the Goddesses. Worshipped a male god! Ha ha! You believe that?? A male god! Hush! I think I hear them whispering again...
Uncle BillINTRO |= How are you settling in? I hope you're not finding the chores too much of a bother. I'm not as young as I used to be, so I can't do everything myself.
Uncle BillINTRO |= Not that that's why I brought you here! Haha. Me and your aunt always wanted children, but we were never blessed. If only she was here now...
Uncle BillINTRO |= She always loved this time of year. The Festival of Summertide is coming up soon, and the whole of the Vale will be preparing for it.
Uncle BillINTRO |= Us too. We need the Goddess Druida to smile on us and bring us prosperity, so I'm counting on you both to help. It'll be fun, you'll see!
Uncle BillINTROOLD_PAD |= *cough* Good to have you around. Must be much better out in the open air than spending all that time in a big sweaty shoe? I won't lie; my health hasn't been great, so I need the help, and I will reward you for every task. Look around the farm and gather any tools you may need.
Uncle BillINTROOLD_PAD |= I will leave your task money beside your bed for when you wake up every morning and will add the daily tasks to your list, so don't forget to check!
Uncle BillINTROOLD_KBM |= *cough* Good to have you around. Must be much better out in the open air than spending all that time in a big sweaty shoe? I won't lie; my health hasn't been great, so I need the help, and I will reward you for every task. Look around the farm and gather any tools you may need.
Uncle BillINTROOLD_KBM |= I will leave your task money beside your bed for when you wake up every morning and will add the daily tasks to your list, so don't forget to check!
TwigINTRO |= Hallo, hallo! You got me letter! Name's Twig, but you can call me Twig. Not sure why I got that name. Probably 'cos I look like a stick.
TwigINTRO |= Had a little help writing it, 'course. Our dream pal, you know, he can do marvellous things. Wouldn't have made it to Master Fisherman without his help!
TwigINTRO |= You know who I'm talking about, right? Mr Fairweather! He's got big plans for you. That's why you and me have got to stick together.
TwigINTRO |= First off, I'm gonna teach you one of me fishing tricks. Just show me you can catch a common-as-muck Pondlurker with this old rod. Won't have no trouble finding a pond with a few swimming about. Try straight down that way. Good luck!

GeneralChatPott |= Nice to see your ugly mug up and about.

GeneralChatPott |= What's Fairweather like? I heard he's a big lad.
GeneralChatPott |= Have you met Mr Hawthorn yet?
GeneralChatPott |= Always wanted to go to Evergreen and try their drinks.
GeneralChatPott |= Don't cross those Fae from Voide if you ever meet one. Snobbish lot!
GeneralChatPott |= Your breath smells like chewed compost today.
GeneralChatPott |= Whatcha milling around for?
GeneralChatPott |= Look busy. Druida's watchin' yer.
GeneralChatPott |= I've seen healthier cheeks on a Remnant.
GeneralChatPott |= You need to lose a bit of weight from yer brain.
GeneralChatPott |= Us Brounies do love a good polish.
GeneralChatPott |= Can you not put fingerprints on those winders?

GeneralChatPott |= You should learn to cook. Again.

GeneralChatPott |= I'm the only Brounie you can see. Honoured?
GeneralChatPott |= I have had this hat 200 years, ya know? It's brand new.
GeneralChatPott |= Housework won't do itself. Well, it will but ssshhh.
GeneralChatPott |= How's it goin'?
GeneralChatPott |= It's weather we are having today.
GeneralChatPott |= Look how shiny I got those winders.
GeneralChatPott |= Spit n shine. Shine n spit!
GeneralChat |= Just wondering as I wander.
GeneralChat |= A lot of us look alike, have you noticed?
GeneralChat |= We Wanderers love the open road. No home to call our own, just the wind for company.
GeneralChat |= I can't remember my youth. My memory is as hazy as the summer evenings.
GeneralChat |= I love to go a-wandering. Here, there and Neverwhere.
GeneralChat |= Onions and bunions. The two things that every Wanderer carries with them. Both make you cry and are crunchy to chew on
GeneralChat |= Never stray into the dark forests. Many hungry Wanderers sometimes drift into them, and you never see them again.
GeneralChat |= Where do we get our money? By selling the things that nature's bounty provides and making sure we offer to the Goddesses
GeneralChat |= We wanderers never settle nor marry outside our kind. We never beg nor want for anything. It is us and the open sky as our ceiling, and the stars are our candles.
GeneralChat |= Hello homelubber.
GeneralChat |= One of the lucky ones to escape the Shoe!
GeneralChat |= I often think of my time in the Shoe. Magical times and an unforgettable odour.
GeneralChat |= Wanderers together, Orphans all.
GeneralChat |= We Wanderers do actually have a place we can go and call our own. It is in the north west of Quill, safe and warm under the ground.
GeneralChat |= Blessings on you, lucky one.
GeneralChat |= I love walking around these parts. There's a certain smell that gives me comfort.
GeneralChat |= Hello! Can't stop! Wandering to do.

Petyr the PanINTRO |= Browse, please! We have a range of goods for you to faun over. I used to sell everything from thimbles to exotic breads, but we have naan here anymore.

Uncle BillDay4 |= Well, here's sleepy head! I don't really have that much for you to do today, but it would be good if you could deliver some milk to Old Mother Hubbard over in Candlewych Cottage.
Uncle BillDay4 |= She's the Master Cook of Quill, so might be able to give you a few tips. I don't mean carrot tips.
Uncle BillDay4 |= It's quite a long walk, so will do you some good. Just use a metal bucket on old Butterscotch there to fill it with milk. Otherwise, the day is your own. Take care out there.
Uncle BillDaySickle |= You need a sickle to harvest wheat or cut through long grass. Our old sickle rusted so we need a new one. Jeremie's Irons in the village should be able to help.
SiblingDay4 |= Uncle Bill seems very kind to you. I often think about our real parents. I can't remember them at all. We must have been given away when very young. Do you think they were too poor to feed us? Did they die fighting monsters? Were we bad children? We will never truly know.
SiblingDay5 |= Uncle is unwell. Why don't you get off your backside and find a way to help him? Try the Apothecary in the village.
Uncle BillDay6 |= Today is just an ordinary day, really, just like any other. Have you been to the noticeboard in the village?
Uncle BillDay6 |= It's just opposite the Goods Store. It's worth checking there to see if any of the villagers need some help.
Uncle BillDay6 |= While you are down there, it's pig auction day. We can't afford a new pig, but why don't you nip down to the auction stall in Festival Green and get some experience of them?
Uncle BillDay7 |= Morning! I'm off to Festival Green to pay homage to Druida. Every week we make her an offering on Goddess Day so that she will smile on us.
Uncle BillDay7 |= And with Summertide almost here, it's more important than ever that we gain her favour.
Uncle BillDay7 |= Why don't you meet me down there and I'll show you? It's about time you learned our ways. You won't get far in life without the blessings of the Goddesses!
Uncle BillDay7WorshipSetup |= Glad you could join me! There are few things I can teach you that are more important than the rituals of the Goddesses. How we worship determines how we live and what fate has in store for us.
Uncle BillDay7WorshipSetup |= Everywhere you go, you'll find Goddess statues, where you can make an offering on a Goddess Day like this one. But what pleases one Goddess may offend another, so take care to see what effect your offering will have.
Uncle BillDay7WorshipSetup |= Whatever boons and blessings you earn will last all week, but so will the misfortunes. So be sure to choose wisely and consult the statues to see where you stand with each Goddess.
Uncle BillDay7WorshipSetup |= Don't neglect them, though. If you fail to make any offerings or insult them with poor gifts, you might find yourself jinxed or even cursed. Worzel Scrumpy keeps trying to catch flies now and then with his tongue!
Uncle BillDayIll |= I seem to be a bit unwell today. My old stomach is turning like a windmill in a gale.\nCould you pop along to the Apothecary in the village and see if old Lemmy and Boots can prescribe something to help? Thanks.
Uncle BillIllCured |= Ah, thanks a lot! This should do the trick. Been having these troubles on and off ever since my Rose passed. Lemmy said it was likely stress or that I swallowed a Grubbling once, and it lives in there, causing trouble now and then.
Uncle BillDayMilk |= Sleep well? I dreamt I was a cow. Speaking of which, could you do some milk deliveries for me today? I will add them to your Task List.
Uncle BillDayMilk |= They say cows are cursed people, doomed to eternally eat grass and get milked. Creepy if you think of it! Anyway, best get on!
Uncle BillDayTwig |= Had this letter left slipped under the door for you. By the state of that writing, I expect it's that strange lad from the Nook.
Uncle BillDayTwig |= Got to get on with preparing for Summertide so do whatever you want today. Am looking forward to seeing who the Herald is this time!
Uncle BillDay10 |= Not much for you to do today. If you are at a loose end, you can always explore or even create a task for yourself. Look at your task list, and there is a create task option. Now you can make your own entertainment!
Uncle BillDay3SeedsComplete |= Ahh, beautiful seeds. Now you can see how good it feels to watch something you've planted yourself grow. Just stick them in the soil patches and give them a good soak.
SiblingDay3SeedsComplete |= Oh, what seeds did you get? Did Uncle Bill tell you to use the watering can? 'Cos you got to water them every day, or they'll dry up and stop growing. That must be what happened to me, or we'd have a whole bunch of chocolate plants by now.
Jeremie SmithDay4SickleIntro |= Well, hello there, young 'un. Hmm, all out of sickles, I'm afraid. I'm also afraid of going into the mine to dig for ore, which is why we're out of sickles. I heard some knocking, so I got straight out of there!
Jeremie SmithDay4SickleIntro |= But tell you what, here's the key to the mine. If you're brave enough to get your own ore, pop back into the Smithy, and I'll show you how to make your own sickle. Goddesses go with you because I sure am not!
Jeremie SmithDay4SickleIntro |= You'll find the mine behind our house, which is up and left from the Smithy. You probably won't run into any Knockers but just in case, it was nice knowing you.
Geoffrey BlackDay4SickleIntro |= You'll have to speak to Jeremie for all your sickle-related enquiries.
Geoffrey BlackDay4SickleIntroBegone |= Best be careful in that mine. It's a health and safety nightmare, that place.
Jeremie SmithDay4GotOre |= Well, drop an anvil on my toe! Here you are, alive and with a pocketful of ore! You've earned a lesson in the noble art of smithing, that's for sure. Get a hold of the chain on that forge, and we'll get started.
TraderStallCalls |= Get yer goods here!
TraderStallCalls |= Quality goods for sale!
Mother HubbardINTRO |= Curried custard! Oh, sorry, didn't see you there. Just had a new recipe idea. Name's Old Mother Hubbard - Master Cook, sorceress of sauces, prodigy of porridges, virtuoso of victuals.\nThe gardens of the Goddesses themselves are perfumed with the aromas coming from my kitchen. That's how good I am!
Mother HubbardINTRO |= Now, as a Master, it is my sworn duty to pass on my skills to anyone who wants to learn. So if you want to become a doyen of dough, a guru of gruel, a shaman of soup, bring whatever ingredients I ask for. You'll see that my recipes bring all sorts of marvellous boons.
Mother HubbardINTRO |= We'll start with something easy. Bring me an ordinary cabbage, and I'll show you how to transform it into hearty, delectable stew. It does have some socially awkward side effects, but flatulence is a small price for keeping you full for a good long while.
Mother HubbardINTRO |= You'll see that using ingredients to whip up delicious dishes is much better than eating raw ingredients like a rube. The benefits are greater and last longer. So bring me that cabbage and we'll get started!
Mother HubbardRetrievedRecipe |= Wonderful! A Master always keeps a promise, so let's pounce on the stove so I can show you the basics.
Mother HubbardFIRST_SKILL |= Ah, the humble yet mighty cabbage. Let's turn it into the aptly named Simpleton's Stew, which even a halfwit could make without much trouble. Of course, most of the people in the Vale are quarterwits... Anyway, as you cook, be sure to look at the trait of each ingredient, if you've managed to learn them.\nYou'll find plenty of tips in a book I have lying around here, but the most important thing is to get your timings right so everything cooks at the same time. And don't forget to check with me now and again to see what you need before I can teach you more skills. Who knows? You might be good enough for us to have a cook-off one day. *wink*
Mother HubbardBakingIntro |= Ahhh, nothing quite compares to baking. The intoxicating aromas, the magical crusting of pastry, the ethereal rising of a cake mix... And I hope to share this dark art with you in some not-too-distant updating of our Quillian existence.
Ash BrownCollecting |= Oh, is nature not an intoxicating bliss? And among all creatures, none deserve my lyrical odes as much as the majestic insects that flit and flutter among us. All one needs to entrap these miraculous hexapods is a jar.
Ash BrownCollecting |= Some people like to keep them in such glass cages forever or even bound them in books like frozen little poems. But I rather set them free so that they might continue to fill our world with their vibrant hues.

TwigGrottoIntro |= Twig twog twiggleleedee, Mr Fairweather's waiting for thee! Oh, you must be bursting with excitement? Not many get to meet a real proper Fae.
TwigGrottoIntro |= Now follow them Faery Lights, and I'll dream-hop myself to the crossroads in DRUIDA'S CROSS to the SOUTH and meet you there!
TwigGrottoDruida |= Are you awake, or are you asleep? Well, here's something you'll be wanting to keep! A gift from Mr Fairweather hisself.
TwigGrottoDruida |= It's a really special lantern called the Obscura, and it lets you see things that are normally hidden to those without true sight! Let's just pop that there Glass lens of yours in it. Excitin'!
TwigGrottoDruida |= But don't stop now! Keep following the Faeries, and I'll see you in the SOUTH EAST corner of TESTY ACRES.
TwigGrottoTesty |= We're all just strands in a giant ball of twine, but your wishes will come true deep in the mine! I've got the key for you here.
TwigGrottoTesty |= Just follow the Faeries all the way to the first mine you come to in Crumblechalk.
TwigGrottoGo |= Here you are, in the right place at the right time. No more listening to daft Twig rhyme. Now go on and shine the Obscura onto the big stones while you stand on the circle.
TwigGrottoGo |= Move the beam around until it opens a door. Mr Fairweather waits on the other side, with gifts and treasures you can't imagine. But be careful what you wish for!
Lemmy SippDay5ApothIntro |= Oh, Bill has a bit of a dicky tummy eh? Well, normally we'd prescribe Abdo-Mend powder for Food Poisoning, but we are all out of Cuckoo Dew and Bloodfew. If you gather those for me I'll teach you how to make it. How does that sound?
Lemmy SippDay5ApothIntro |= You can find Cuckoo Dew in Cuckoo Wood mainly. Bloodfew is a bit trickier, but proverbs should help you locate some. Off you go then!
Boots WintersDay5ApothIntro |= Oh, Bill has a bit of a dicky tummy eh? Well, normally, we'd prescribe Abdo-Mend powder, but we are all out of Cuckoo Dew and Bloodfew. If you gather those for me I'll give you some. How does that sound?
Boots WintersDay5ApothIntro |= You can find Cuckoo Dew in Cuckoo Wood mainly. Bloodfew is a bit trickier, but proverbs should help you locate some. Off you go then!
Boots WintersDay5ApothGotDew |= Ahh, just the ticket! Here you go!
Uncle BillMadeSickle |= Nicely done on that sickle by the way. Kept meaning to say. That's very impressive work. Smithing is hard work but can build up your muscles for sure. I prefer the smells of the farm. Pig muck over pig iron, for sure.
TwigGrottoEnterPortal |= Now goes on and meets Mr Fairweather. He's an odd sort, but he has amazin' gifts! And be careful what ya wish for!
Jeremie SmithApprenticeLine |= Well done! You will make a fine smith. You are welcome to use the forge any time, but you do need to provide the ore. I will pay you per item you make at the selling table.  One day you might even make something as great as the hammer my father gave me as an heirloom. I daren't use it as it is so precious!
Jeremie SmithApprentice |= Great! Well, like I said, if you provide the ore then you can make as much as you want. Use the selling table if you want to earn some money from what you make.
GATE |= What's yer business here?

BlacksmithApprenticeTutorialSelection |= Let's begin your Smithing apprenticeship!\n\nStart by selecting an ore and a mould. You only have <item:Tin_Ore> and a <item:Sickle_Mould>, but there are many more materials and moulds out there to create anything from jewellery to swords!
BlacksmithApprenticeTutorialBellows |= Melt your ore by holding and releasing <bs_press> to blow the bellows.
BlacksmithApprenticeTutorialHeat |= Lower the item to the forge and heat it by pressing <bs_press>, then press <bs_press> again to remove it - aim for the green marker on the scale!
BlacksmithApprenticeTutorialCool |= Cool the item by pressing <bs_press> to lower it into the water. Then press <bs_press> again to remove it - aim for the green marker on the scale!
BlacksmithApprenticeTutorialHammer |= Press <bs_press> to hammer the item into shape. Aim to totally cover the target. Increase your strength to earn more hits.

BlacksmithApprenticeTutorialEnd |= Great stuff!\n\nYou can store made items in different places to suit your needs or keep it for yourself!\n\nYou made your first item in a Blacksmith. I feel you could become really good at this in time!\nMaybe one day you might even own your own Smithing business!
TravellingTraderDesc |= Salesmen have travelled the lands for centuries, selling everything from Vacuum Cleaners to Knives. In ancient times they went house to house and sold religious tomes, known as Playboy Magazine.

PigRacingDesc |= Pig Racing is enjoyed throughout Quill by adult and child alike. Spend some money and have some fun. One day you might even get to breed and race your own fine steeds. And by steeds, I mean bacon on legs.
PigMarketDesc |= Have you run out of juicy bacon? All your pigs popped? Then you need the Pig Auctions! Come along to the Festival Green and bid for the bacon in its rawest form. Alive and not on a plate.

Harry BuckleINTRO |= To brew! To mead! Can I get thee sommat to sup? My brother 'n' I run the local drinking ebstashblissment. Burp! I think I may have much too drunk!
Saul BuckleINTRO |= To mead! To brew! A flagon for when yer flaggin'? My brother and meself own the local pub. You must pop in sometime. Not literally! That would be messy and you don't look like a balloon!
Rock SaltINTRO |= Anything you need in particular? I am a busy man. There is too much joviality around these parts, and I have no time for japes or idle banter.
Celia SaltINTRO |= Oh, hello! It's exciting to see a new face around here. It would be nice to talk sometime. Conversation is thin on the ground in this house.
Roman SaltINTRO |= Glub! Bwaaaa.
Peter PepperINTRO |= Wahey! Welcome! Smell my finger! Know any good jokes? Apart from your face? Zing! Last time I saw someone with hair like yours, I was at a sheep market. Kadumph!
Carolina PepperINTRO |= Oh, please tell me not another joker. There comes a time in one's life when the jokes cease to sparkle, when puns lose their lustre, and the only thing left is to make vague references.
Belle PepperINTRO |= I'm Belle! You can give me a ring anytime, cutie! I am like a calendar; I just love dates. And prunes.
Rosie CrustINTRO |= Oh, fluffy crusts my lover! Welcome to Poppyhill! Home of the greatest pies and pastries known to woman. I just keep achin' to get bakin'! I'd love to pop your cherry...onto one of my cakes.
Finn CrustINTRO |= Ooh good day to you! A fellow fancier of pie? A cake connoisseur? Perhaps a bun bandit! Keep your hands off my wife's baps!
Herbie WeedINTRO |= Heyyy there you. If you need any medicinal plants, then I'm your man, man. Our prices may be higher, but being high is not a bad thing is it?
Ivy WeedINTRO |= Hi there. You look like the type who knows how to mix pleasure and pleasure. I could mix you something to give you extra energy and make every sense a rainbow of dancing starlight.
Hannah HammerINTRO |= How do. We make pretty good items in our Smithy, so if you want to buy owt, Nerys is yer woman. I shape, she ships.
Nerys NailINTRO |= Hello there! I'm Nerys Nail. It's funny because I work in a blacksmiths where we make nails. I prefer painting nails than making them personally *giggle*.
Edward WoodINTRO |= Well, greetings! Welcome to Summerdown. Good to see a new face that isn't full of crumbs and sauce stains. Just me and Daisy here. She's not the trusting type since what happened to her mother, but she's a good lass.
Daisy WoodINTRO |= Hello. Dad said I have to be polite to everyone. Treat others how you want to be treated yourself, dad says.
Poppy SeedINTRO |= Oooh! Well, hello sapling. You look like a person who could show a girl the darkest corners of the forest. We should go explore them sometime. You bring the wood, and I will make the fire.
Kane HinesINTRO |= Hello. Are you a lover of dogs too. I am. I love dogs. I write books too. Perhaps you have read them? They are very useful. Did you know a dog shakes its tail when happy. I sometimes do that too.
Roger ReadilyINTRO |= Well what do we have here? A strange face, ahhh but a pretty one. I am at your service, and servicing is what I do best. Readily by name, Roger by nature. Woof!
Rose ThornINTRO |= Welcome, welcome! Spirits and Goddesses bless you this day. An incantation I whisper in your honour, and my aura warms in your presence.
JogonINTRO |= Och! Have ye come to batter some beasties? Mash up some monsters? Not in that state ye aren't! Not seen ye before, and I would feel bad if I was to let ye go wandering in there and get eaten.
JogonINTRO |= I am Jogon, Master of hand-to-hand combat. I can teach ye the basics to at least let myself feel slightly less guilty when ye do get chomped on like a meat lollipop.
JogonINTRO |= Meet me inside the barrow just over there to the west, and let's get cracking...some skulls! Bring a sword!
JogonCOMBAT_TUTORIAL_NEED_WEAPON |= What?! I told ye to bring a sword. Go get one from Poppyhill blacksmiths or wherever. C'mon! Pull it together! It's all about the preparation!"
JogonCOMBAT_TUTORIAL_BEGIN |= Ready to learn the fine art of clobberin'? Then let's get cracking...some ribs!
Herbert LemonLEAVEVALE |= Tragedy and Fae dealings! Herbert knows such things. Herbert also knows what you seek. Now you are of age you can pass the Gate and find it, yes you can! Seek The Circle!
Herbert LemonLEAVEVALE |= The world beyond waits, with adventure and danger! Herbert wishes you well. If you need to protect yourself, seek Master Jogon in Rivermoor, just beyond this door. Now go you must!
FairweatherINTRO |= I'm so pleased you could join me again. Now you have seen what true shadows look like. You have seen what a farce the world of humans is. Forcing a child to choose a sacrifice? What small-minded, pitiful creatures they are.
FairweatherINTRO |= But not you. With you begins a lineage that will accomplish wonders. A dynasty that will achieve complete mastery over all things. And all it takes is...a seed.
FairweatherINTROExtra |= The Kynseed. Once it flowers you will be bonded to its magic and though you may succumb to the irresistible call of the grave, your essence will live on as a guardian of your progeny - and each generation stronger than the last. Your spirit will be stronger than any Quill has seen before.
FairweatherINTROExtra |= But first...you must agree to a contract. A mere formality, I assure you.
FairweatherINTRO2 |= Splendid. Then our covenant is in place. Now you must plant the seed on the hill above the house you call home. Its roots will be your roots. And it will flower many times, just as your family will.
FairweatherINTRO2 |= But that is not my only gift tonight. You have already experienced what drudgery and hard work life can bring, and these trinkets can ease your burden. You may choose one of them now, though you will be able to call upon me in the future if you wish to trade for more.
FairweatherINTRO2 |= In any case, I will pay you a visit as midnight strikes at the year's end to collect my modest fee for any services rendered. Until the next time, my child.
FairweatherTillNextYear |= I applaud your eagerness, my child, but even my power to bestow gifts has its limits. You will have to wait until next year. It will be worth the wait, believe me.

ChatOptionSecretLikedItem |= Voici un secret pour toi... mon item préféré est <VAR1>.

ChatOptionSecretLikedItemOtherNPC |= Voici un secret pour toi... J'ai entendu que <VAR1> aime <VAR2>.

ChatOptionGossipAgeSelf |= J'ai <VAR1> ans.
ChatOptionGossipBirthday |= Mon anniversaire est le <VAR1>.
ChatOptionGossipBirthdayOther |= I heard <VAR1> was the day <VAR2> was born.
ChatOptionGossip |= Careless talk costs lives. Well, not lives, but something else probably.
ChatOptionGossip |= If you want tittle-tattle, go talk to tattle tittles!
ChatOptionGossip |= I am sorry but if I told you, I would have to sacrifice you.
ChatOptionGossip |= Dead men tell no tales. Live ones who tell tales end up dead.
ChatOptionGossip |= Have I any gossip? Yes. Can you have it? Not yet. 
ChatOptionGossip |= If you can appease or control Knockers, then you can get them to do your mining for you.\nI wonder if there is such a way? It sounds like I am hinting!
ChatOptionGossip |= Did you hear the rhyme about the Buggane? Under bloodied moon by purple pools, the Buggane drinks the waters cool.
ChatOptionGossip |= Do you know why the ancients used iron nails to bury their dead in wooden boxes? Tin wasn't invented. Possibly.
ChatOptionGossip |= Beware of Fel! They change their shape and walk among us! They trick and deceive and play their games! Beware of people with strange names, I tell you! Which, admittedly, is practically everybody in Quill.
ChatOptionGossip |= Legend tells of a magical sack that could catch monsters and make them your servant. It was woven with dragon mane hair, and they say it was sold to a man with big teeth. What I wouldn't give for such a thing!
ChatOptionGossip |= Tickling Tom Hookfingers giggles as he tickles you. Apparently you laugh and scream at the same time if he catches you.
ChatOptionGossip |= There is a rumour within a rumour within a rumour that someone in Quill discovered the existence of a legendary sword. A sword so covered in myth and mystery that steps were taken to erase it from the memory of man and Fae alike. Could such a weapon exist? My very mentioning it probably leads you to believe it does.
ChatOptionGossip |= There once lived a woman who found a baby fox tangled in an old tree root. It is said it had a tail made of flames, but they blazed cold rather than heat. It is likely it ran from its Fae owner and became lost. One day the fox vanished, but a small bag of silver was left on her windowsill.
ChatOptionGossipVALE |= That trader told me he saw a Jabberwock! Said it was tangerine orange and looked like an uncooked chicken that breathed evil green flames. Do you think one got out of the forest?
ChatOptionGossipVALE |= Some wanderer told me that there was an unnatural fog over Stonecrown and he could hear singing within it and that he saw 12 headless ladies dancing across the moor. He also told me he had downed a few pints and that he had a pet dragon called Bert.
ChatOptionGossipVALE |= Did you know that Mellowfields folk wash their hands after using the toilet? Disgusting!
ChatOptionGossipVALE |= Strange murmurings from up north. Moving puddles that grab your ankles. Hopping one-eyed beasts and a cat who can predict the death of your pet fish.
ChatOptionGossipVALE |= That wanderer said there was a rain like no other up in Tunt last week. Someone must have really annoyed Aurore!
ChatOptionGossipVALE |= I found an iron nail stuck in my door the other morning. Someone is trying to warn me. Or it's for hanging something on.
ChatOptionGossipVALE |= Those barrows in Rivermoor are scary. Apparently, if you try to stay the night in one, the spirits tell you to bugger off! There are whispers that the dead meet there to dance. I can't imagine such a thing. I reckon if you saw that it would be a thriller!
ChatOptionGossipVALE |= I heard the Old Woman Who Lives in a Shoe is an orphan herself.
ChatOptionGossipVALE |= Where did the Old Woman Who Lives in a Shoe get that shoe?! Where is the other? There must be a giant hopping around somewhere!
ChatOptionGossipVALE |= If you sprinkle Parsley on your hair after the first day of Spring, you get green hair. True that. Honest.
ChatOptionGossipVALE |= They apparently had a hare problem up at Olive Ridge in Cunning Plots. Now whether that be rabbits digging up the garden or a baldness problem, I don't rightly know.
ChatOptionGossipVALE |= Some fella up in Pinehaven claims he saw the Sagtyt Witch running around during a storm. It was the same night Old Annie Cap vanished.
ChatOptionGossipVALE |= Don't sleep in fairy rings! The little flappy buggers will put spiders in your ears and steal your socks!
ChatOptionGossipVALE |= I ate some dandelion soup last night for supper and the evening dragged on.
ChatOptionGossipVALE |= Those Crumblechalk mines run deep, they say, but nobody knows how to get into them. I am not sure I would dare venture too far, though...bad things are found when you dig too deep!
ChatOptionGossipVALE |= Have you ever seen Fred Barleycorn bounce through Mellowfields in Autumn? He is quite a sight!
ChatOptionGossipVALE |= Light your fire on a winter eve, lest you get poops that freeze.
ChatOptionGossipVALE |= You should try Poppyhill Goods Store if you are a fan of baked goods. They do a pie with pastry so light you could float over Quill after eating one.
ChatOptionGossipVALE |= Poppyhill Music Festival is something special. Bards and musicians from across the land gather to burst your eardrums while people sell you souvenir tat at bloated prices. I bought an imprinted shirt that said 'A Rolling Stone Gathers No Moss'. It was a proverbial rip-off.
ChatOptionGossipVALE |= Have you ever been to the Farting Festival in Woemarsh? I heard it's a gas. I am pumped to go next year.
ChatOptionGossipVALE |= I heard someone's crops failed in Mellowfields. That's what you get if you don't pay respect to our beloved Goddesses!
ChatOptionGossipSUMMERDOWN |= From the Vale eh? I heard they sacrifice their wives down there if they are not bearing children. Unbelievable!
ChatOptionGossipSUMMERDOWN |= Our annual music festival is in Autumn. You should come along and experience the festivities.
ChatOptionGossipSUMMERDOWN |= Sometimes, on a clear, crisp winter's night, if you gaze at the distant peaks, you can sometimes see the glow of Dragonfire as it warms its cave.
ChatOptionGossipSUMMERDOWN |= Have you ever been to The Shingles? The entrance to Midwood looms there and just seeing those trees looking down on you makes your snot turn white.
ChatOptionGossipSUMMERDOWN |= A wanderer was here last week, telling tales about how he took a wrong turn in fog on the way to Gaslight. Claims he saw Daddy Long Legs strolling around the marsh. Good thing that Daddy Long Legs didn't see him!
ChatOptionGossipSUMMERDOWN |= I put an apple core under my pillow to give the Dreamstokers something to nibble on and keep bad dreams at bay.
ChatOptionGossipSUMMERDOWN |= They say a horseshoe is lucky, but since horses are now extinct, I would say that superstition was a load of cobblers.
ChatOptionGossipSUMMERDOWN |= Blue lights in the swamps. People say they are the souls of lost travellers. Others say they are very bright moths. I tell you this for free, though (put your money away)...moths can't sing. Whatever you do, do not follow the lights!
ChatOptionGossipSUMMERDOWN |= It seems to always rain in Woemarsh. It's that fine rain that soaks you through.
ChatOptionGossipSUMMERDOWN |= Moon is the Master archer of Quill. She can shoot the nits out of your hair.
ChatOptionGossipMELLOWFIELDS |= We have our vegetable festival each year. You should bring some quality veggies along and join in the festivities.
ChatOptionGossipMELLOWFIELDS |= I once met a man who said he heard the Banshee singing. He said if he hadn't got his foot stuck in a rabbit hole, he would have walked to his death.
ChatOptionGossipMELLOWFIELDS |= Everybody cheats to get their veggies to be the biggest. I reckon some of em use Fae help to inflate their pumpkins. I wish I could prove it!
ChatOptionGossipMELLOWFIELDS |= I reckon the miners of Deepstone will dig too deep one day and come out at the other side of the world. I would love to know what is there. I reckon it's a place ruled by fishmen and fish ladies.
ChatOptionGossipMELLOWFIELDS |= Want some juicy gossip? I heard some fellow over in the Vale sacrificed his wife because she was fallow and unable to take seed. I know it is legal, but that sort of thing happens very rarely! I once offered up a chicken, and I felt bad for weeks after, although I did get very nice carrots that season.
ChatOptionGossipMELLOWFIELDS |= Why do the Fae love visiting Quill so much? On market day, the smell of sheep farts could melt your windows. That might smell nice to a Mossman or Dryad, but Fairies love everything squeaky clean and sweet, according to the authorities on the subject.
ChatOptionGossipMELLOWFIELDS |= To reach Nirvana, the ancient ones would place four objects on a plinth. These were a mullet hoe, an albino, a mosquito and some libido. That's what the words on the scrolls said. Don't believe me? Ok, whatever, never mind.
ChatOptionGossipMELLOWFIELDS |= I recall that song about the Nymphs of Simplewood. 'Beware the things with flappy wings. Beware their claws and horrid stings. Sate them with poured honey do...but never ever feed them poo'.
ChatOptionGossipMELLOWFIELDS |= Have you been to see Marshtyt? He lives in Twanging Gardens. He is a bit fruity so watch yourself around him. If he suggests having a look in the greenhouse, decline politely. It's way too hot in those greenhouses.
ChatOptionGossipMELLOWFIELDS |= Mossmen and Dryads live in E'ergreen. They say they take human form when they visit Quill. I think tree-people should not feel the need to disguise themselves. They would be very poplar. Poplar! Gettit?!
ChatOptionGossipMELLOWFIELDS |= Have you been to see The Dancers? Not many go there because of the eerie sounds. Nobody knows who put them there or what they do. I would bet my last turnip that they are part of some extravagant secret which, when uncovered by some sort of protagonist, would surprise and delight. Or make them soil themselves. Gotta be one or the other.
ChatOptionGossipMELLOWFIELDS |= They say an old lady called Betty went to The Dancers one night, and a young girl walked out of the woods the next morning, claiming to be her. Nobody believed her and she was sacrificed to Freyl so that no ill would befall the Haven. The weird thing, though, is that nobody ever saw old Betty again.
ChatOptionGossipMELLOWFIELDS |= A man had 7 apples in one hand and 12 apples in the other? What did he have? Big hands! That's not really gossip, but do be on the lookout for a man with huge hands.
ChatOptionGossipMELLOWFIELDS |= Take heed of this advice. Never stand by a puddle in Midwood.
ChatOptionGossipMELLOWFIELDS |= They say Aurore created Autumn when she caught a rainbow and tied the ends together. She put the rainbow on her finger and danced over Quill with joy. She was so taken aback by the beautiful colours that she wept. Her tears were as rain, and her breath created the mists.\nI hope she didn't tread on anybody!
ChatOptionGossipMELLOWFIELDS |= Have you stood near the entrance to Simplewood and listened carefully? You can hear the giggles of the Nymphs, and the hum of their wings.
ChatOptionGossipMELLOWFIELDS |= I don't know much about history. Don't know much biology. I do know that you should never throw apples at a Forest Hag, though.
ChatOptionGossipWOEMARSH |= The folk of Woemarsh are descended from a tribe of lost actors who liked to dress in colourful costumes and shout "Lightning bolt!" at each other. Not much has changed.
ChatOptionGossipWOEMARSH |= I once met a miller called Mick who was also a contortionist. He was full of himself. He eventually died in his own arms.
ChatOptionGossipWOEMARSH |= Deep in the swamp lies the tomb of the banished Grandmaster. He was cursed with a hideous visage and wanders Dreadwaters at night. All these candles keep him at bay as he hates the smell. I would advise not going there. If he grabs you, that's it!
ChatOptionGossipWOEMARSH |= A magic rabbit once swapped my feet around. It had mix-up-my-toesies. Do you like that joke? I found it written in an ancient book written by a man called Tim, that I found wrapped in vines.
ChatOptionGossipWOEMARSH |= Have you seen that door in Frogmarsh that has frog statues all around it? Some people say it contains a legendary treasure. Others say it is a doorway to a land made of candy. Me? I like to imagine it's a legendary candy treasure. That would be sweet.
ChatOptionGossipWOEMARSH |= What is your opinion on wooden dividers between fields and gardens that people sit on? I am on the fence about them.
ChatOptionGossipWOEMARSH |= They say a black dog of death, Black Barrag, sits outside a person's house for a week before they pass on. I am not sure if normal folks can see it. It does make me wonder if it needs the toilet or eats. Perhaps we should leave invisible bones outside for it to nibble on?
ChatOptionGossipWOEMARSH |= I keep humming that song about the Fachen of Midwood. "Like a Facheny smell, I'll be gone when the morning comes. When the night is over like a Facheny smell, I'll be gone, gone, gone". Hmmm I really fancy some eating some meat loaf now.
ChatOptionGossipWOEMARSH |= Have you met Moon the Archer on your way here? She lives in Drownhill in her colourful tent. She taught me how to use a slingshot but I was so bad at it I kept hitting myself on the bottom. Thinking about it, that is actually really impressive.
ChatOptionGossipWOEMARSH |= Want some absolutely salacious gossip? Something really, really steamy to get the blood flowing? A piece of gossip so outrageous, that your eyes will pop out of your head and you may need a dip in a freezing river to cool yourself down? Me too, have you got any?
ChatOptionGossipWOEMARSH |= Keep this to yourself but I heard a very interesting bit of information. There is said to be a strange structure they unearthed while mining in the Ferrous Footway. The miners who lived down there mysteriously vanished, and nobody dare go in there now. No need since the road opened through Wisptrail.
ChatOptionGossipWOEMARSH |= There was a woman who made rugs for a living. One day a Fae knocked on her door and asked for her to make a rug for his bald head. She trimmed his beard off and wove him a rug that was warm and cosy. As a thank you, he gave her some of his armpit hair. She thought it must be magical and maybe never run out or have healing properties. Nope. It was just a bundle of sweaty, worthless, powerless armpit hair.
ChatOptionGossipWOEMARSH |= A man had a duck that thought he was its mother. It would follow him around all day and sleep by him at night. One night he was having a romantic dream and kissed the duck as he slept. In the morning he woke up to find a beautiful woman wasn't in his bed. The duck was.
ChatOptionGossipWOEMARSH |= Take heed of this advice. Never let a Banshee scream in your face. You will pretty much die. I am not actually sure who found that out the hard way.
ChatOptionGossipWOEMARSH |= They say Hyalis sits playing with her scales in Opal. She is always weighing up life against death and keeping the scales balanced. They also say she enjoys crochet, painting by numbers and collecting bottles, but the man who told me that was very drunk.
ChatOptionGossipWOEMARSH |= They say that when the Blood Moon shines in the night sky, the monsters of the woods become more ferocious. I just know that when the sky turns red, it reminds me I need to buy more tomatoes.
ChatOptionGossipWOEMARSH |= The Goddess Morwenna rules the swamps of Woemarsh and protects the people from the ravages of time. To what end, we may never know. Some people may think it is a punishment, not a blessing. Sounds like one for the budding theorists out there!

Uncle BillDay6BoughtPig |= Oh! You bought a pig! That will come in very handy. This farm is definitely on the up! Nice work! I can sense you will be a great entrepreneur one day!
SiblingDay6BoughtPig |= How did you afford that pig? Uncle Bill must be pleased. Nice to see you use some initiative!
Lucy ArrowsDay9Intro |= Oh, you got my letter and came! That's so great of you. I absolutely adore history and lore. For years I have studied this henge and have not unlocked its secrets. I personally believe it is a gateway to where the Fae live. I came across an old tome that mentioned shining a light at it.
Lucy ArrowsDay9Intro |= Would you try focusing your lantern beam on the henge while I watch for any signs of magic? Perhaps try standing on the circle and turn on your lantern, then use the right stick on gamepad or move your mouse cursor away to focus the beam.
Lucy ArrowsDay9Wrapup |= Hmmm, that doesn't seem to be it. I will keep trying to transcribe the book and see if there are any other special requirements. Thank you for your help. Here's 5 Brass for your trouble.
Ash BrownDay11Intro |= Ah, great to see you! I am so glad you came. I discovered a passage in a nature book about a butterfly called 'The Silver Skipper'. The legend says that if you throw a pear into the glowing pool by the Face Tree before 6pm, then it will appear. This is when you must use your jar and capture it!
Ash BrownDay11Intro |= Sadly I do not know exactly where this tree is, so if you look to the east side of Cuckoo Wood, that would be helpful. I shall be here if you need me. Here is a jar! Good luck!
Ash BrownFoundButterfly |= You found it! Amazing! The legend was true! It is so beautiful. I could stare at it all day, but finders keepers. You will make a great Naturalist. One day you should visit Irwyn, the Master. He lives in Pinehaven where the nature is meant to be incredible!
Ash BrownNotFoundButterfly |= Any luck? I found nothing. I suspect the legend was likely just someone seeing an Insured Admiral with sunlight glinting off it. Ah well, we tried. I bet Irwyn the Master Naturalist would have found it. He lives in Pinehaven and knows everything I bet!
SiblingDay13 |= Ah, you came. I was just feeling very wistful and was thinking about our real parents. Do you think they are out there somewhere, flittering around or snuggled up in a burrow somewhere?
SiblingDay13 |= I want to leave this place as soon as I reach adulthood. I find the Vale is too backwards and enclosed. I feel suffocated here.
SiblingDay13 |= I hope you will come with me, and we can be who we want to be and live how we want to live. And when the Goddesses call for us, we will gladly go to them and run around the fields as their children. Happy and free...I best get back to the farm.
Uncle BillDay13 |= Hello there. Your sibling seemed a bit maudlin earlier. They have gone for a walk in North Gate to clear the old head fog. Maybe go see what's the matter. First time they've left the farm. Always been a little cold that one. Hardworking and loyal but just a little closed. Not like you at all, really.
Pappy CoweBumpaINTRO |= Oi you! I need to ask yer sommat. I have a problem see. I love milk. I can't get enough of the stuff.\nCow milk is acceptable, but its creaminess is limited. What I need is the right kind of creature to milk. And that is where you come in.
Pappy CoweBumpaINTRO |= I heard a rumour you know how to see the Fae and visit them. I also know from being old and well-read that there exists a fairy creature...the Blobbalobbadobba or something silly like that. It is said the milk from one of those is richer than the Lawne's of Mellowfields. I would love to sup on that before I perish and likely come back as a newt.
Pappy CoweBumpaINTRO |= If you could get me some milk from one of those, then you can have the code to my own family secret box. My terrible family don't deserve to get their hands on my heirloom!

ApothWorkerIntro |= What seems to be the trouble?
ApothWorkerCraft |= Time to go make that.
ApothWorkerPlacebo |= This magical pot is sure to help.
ApothWorkerStored |= This premade cure will help.
ApothWorkerCraftFinished |= Here you go, specially crafted just for you.
ApothWorkerSeller |= I can't buy items right now.
MasterDefaultReply |= I've got nothing to tell you right now.
MasterNoSkillsLeft |= I've got no more skills to teach you.
Combat_Tutorial_Melee_0 |= Right, let's get crackin' with the knackin'! As ye see, you have your 3 positions ye can move to. Each move depletes yer STAMINA a tad. Combat is all aboot STAMINA. Yer STAMINA is shown below yer feet. Try moving up and down with <combat_updown>.
Combat_Tutorial_Melee_1 |= Great! Use that to dodge incoming attacks. Now, clobberin'. See those dummies? Either click on one with yer cursor or use <combat_top>, <combat_left> or <combat_bottom> for the corresponding enemy position. Ye can't directly attack the support at the back, so ye need to remove all other enemies first to bring them forwards in range of your sword. Try whack a few dummies, but watch yer STAMINA. Each hit costs 1 section of STAMINA. And remember this! You can only attack along your lane OR diagonally adjacent...so from the middle position, you can attack top and bottom too, but if at the top or bottom, you can only reach the middle position or the lane you are on!
Combat_Tutorial_Melee_2 |= Nicely done! Now let's add some obstacles. Enemies can place down things on what we call NODES to hurt or hinder you. These are the positions halfway between you and the monsters. Some you can smash, but others you can evade by attacking diagonally. Try smashing these dummies and avoid the obstacles!
Combat_Tutorial_Melee_3 |= Noice!  You can also use items too. Press <combat_item>. Click on the target to use the item, or use the <ui_up> and <ui_down> to highlight the target and press <ui_accept>. Items can be used on yourself, Nodes, or be thrown directly at the enemy. I have given you a selection so try to use them all now!
Combat_Tutorial_Melee_4 |= That's the way, eh? Now let's teach ye some defence! You can block attacks with <combat_block>. Meet Bob the Hob. He is very well trained and won't hurt yer, but try to block his attacks. You can see when he will be able to do an action by that little bar under his health bar, which is the little bar under him. That's not as confusin' as I made it sound!
Combat_Tutorial_Melee_5 |= That's the stuff! However, if a monster has higher STRENGTH than your TOUGHNESS, they will chip damage you through yer block, so either toughen up or be careful! And watch yer HEALTH in the top left. Some items can heal you a tad and in the Forests are CAMPFIRES you can use to heal up too. That's the basics done. I could teach ye about timing yer hits so you can do extra ones in an amazing COMBO, but ye can learn that yerself. Now, let's test ye out against Bob, Grob and Timothy. If ye can get me a tooth from one of them, I'll teach yer a trick!
Combat_Tutorial_Melee_6 |= A knockout! You knocked his tooth right out! As promised, here's a trick that'll save yer skin, should ye be good enough to pull it off under pressure! It's called PARRY. All ye do is time yer BLOCK as the enemy is swinging at yer. If ye do it right, then they will be stunned a mo, and you won't lose stamina and can COUNTER quickly. Parrying can also knock back projectiles, so if someone chucks something at ya, hoy it back at em! Ye can try that out for yerself when yer fightin'. Learn to read the baddies attack tells! Good luck out there, and come see me at ma house in Rivermoor if ye want to learn more Skills.
Combat_Tutorial_Ranged_0 |= In combat, your bow is mainly used to disrupt your enemies. Arrows can break a block instantly, disrupt enemy attacks and remove their stamina. Draw your bow by holding <combat_bow> and use <combat_bowaim> to select an enemy. Release to fire. You can try a quick draw and fire, but make sure your ACCURACY stats are good. I have some targets for you to hit. Your quiver can only hold 6 arrows so use them wisely!
Combat_Tutorial_Ranged_1 |= Your potential glimmers like stars. With use, your bow will become more powerful. A mastered bow is a deadly weapon indeed! But that is all you need to know for now. Return to me at my tent if you wish to learn Skills that will help you become a nightmare for your foes. Farewell for now.

SkillProgress_Garden_0 |= Ahh, I remember when I was starting out. There was another gardener competing for dominion of the local soil patch. Back then, the soil was much rarer, and growing things so much harder. It took real skill.
SkillProgress_Garden_0 |= But, as I was saying, I had a green-fingered rival - some kind of medical condition, I think - whose name was, funnily enough, Greenfinger. We had a beet-off. A duel to see who can grow the best beets in a day. I beat him with a beet of about three feet.
SkillProgress_Garden_1 |= Did you know people are 80% plant-based? That's a true fact. I myself am more 84%, seeing as I was grown off a large tuber. At least that's what my old dad told me, and he only lied about 40% of the time.
SkillProgress_Garden_1 |= That's why I never bathe. Already reached my optimum size, see, so watering myself might turn me into some weird, overgrown creature.
SkillProgress_Garden_2 |= You must be careful when it comes to the business, nay, the art of gardening. It can be a dangerous um... business. And I'm not just talking of turnips that suddenly become sentient and decide to attack you for all the times you made fun of their rude shapes.
SkillProgress_Garden_2 |= You could easily have your heart broken, as I did in my youth. She was a beautiful cabbage, she was. Full, voluptuous leaves, pale as green moonlight... We were so happy. Until she started running with a gang of sprouts. Things were never the same after that...
SkillProgress_Garden_3 |= Did I ever tell you of the time I entered a gardening competition in Mellowfields? It was all anyone could talk about for months: who was the greatest gardener of them all? Even the Fae world turned its devious little eyes on us.
SkillProgress_Garden_3 |= Of course, I call it a competition, but it was really more of a landslide. There'd been lots of rain that year and landslides were common. But I still say I would have won handily even if everyone else hadn't been buried in six tonnes of mud.
SkillProgress_Garden_4 |= You know, every year my garden puts on a terrific surprise birthday party. I mean, I pretend to be surprised, but you can hear the carrots planning the crudites for weeks beforehand!
SkillProgress_Garden_4 |= The worst part is the morning after when we all wake up with a broccoli gin hangover and start remembering the details. So if you notice the asparagus blush and turn the other way when they see me coming, you know why.
SkillProgress_Garden_5 |= The fae don't really understand what gardening is all about. These magical beings just don't have the patience for growing things. They're used to snapping their fingers and bam!  A whole field of toe-nibbling lilies springs up out of nowhere.
SkillProgress_Garden_5 |= Of course, humans aren't much better. I remember I invited an old friend to watch my bacon-streaked petunias coming into bloom and he gave up after less than a week. 
SkillProgress_Garden_6 |= It won't be long before you've achieved gardening mastery! Perhaps one day you'll be as famous as me. I'm the one who invented Jim-o'-Lamps, you know. The idea came to me when I realised that pumpkins have such strong personalities, they really ought to have faces.
SkillProgress_Garden_6 |= I take no responsibility for the Pumpkin Massacres though. If people had just stuck to the plan and given them smiles instead of fangs, everything would have been fine.
SkillProgress_Garden_7 |= You've done it! You are a true master now. My final piece of advice: never buy magic seeds from questionable market stalls run by what may or may not be leprechauns. I made that mistake once, and the seeds grew into this tiny beanstalk with the biggest root system the world has ever seen.
SkillProgress_Garden_7 |= I dug down to explore the caverns the roots made, hoping to find pots of gold or something. But all I saw were strange metal artefacts and odd-looking sunken cities. Real disappointment.

SkillProgress_Cooking_0 |= Want to know the first recipe I ever created? It was a blend of fruits, spices and milk that would have revolutionised the baby food world. Unfortunately, being seven months old, I hadn't learned to read or write, so it's lost in the mists of time.
SkillProgress_Cooking_0 |= I've tried many a time to recreate it, but you'd be surprised how few mothers are willing to let you feed their babies experimental dishes.
SkillProgress_Cooking_1 |= If you want to be a great cook, you need to travel. I spent much of my youth working in the taverns all over Quill, soaking up all the knowledge - and all the gravy - I could. Each cook taught me something new.
SkillProgress_Cooking_1 |= My greatest mentor though was the legendary Percy Pickles. He did things with soups you couldn't imagine. Like make them edible! 
SkillProgress_Cooking_2 |= Here's a tip you won't learn from any cookery books: if you see someone adding salt to your already perfectly seasoned dish, resist the urge to add even more seasoning, to season their seasoning.
SkillProgress_Cooking_2 |= Ah yes, I was a bit of a hothead in my salad days. Probably because I added so many spices to my salads. Oh also, never use dandruff instead of sugar. 
SkillProgress_Cooking_3 |= As word of your culinary skills improves, you'll start gaining all sorts of unusual admirers. At the height of my own fame I was invited to cook for the richest households in all of Quill. And once I was even asked to cater a Fae picnic.
SkillProgress_Cooking_3 |= Well, I say "asked", more like "transported in my sleep to a magical realm". Fortunately, they blindfolded me so I wouldn't see the strange, wild excesses of their party. But, oh, the sounds I heard. They still haunt my dreams.
SkillProgress_Cooking_4 |= It's time you knew the truth. I'm not the real Old Mother Hubbard. Or rather, this old lady you've been talking to is merely the body that used to be her. The real me is... over here.
SkillProgress_Cooking_4_dog |= That's right. I'm a dog. Let's not dwell on it. I've been trapped in this hairy body for more years than I care to remember. And no, it's not what you think. No witch cursed me for stealing their newt eye stew recipe. And no Fae tricked me into this in exchange for rare ingredients or anything like that. I'll tell you more another time. Right now, it's almost time for my flea remedy.
SkillProgress_Cooking_5_dog |= I suppose you're wondering how I came to inhabit the body of this dog? Well, if you must know, it was a recipe gone wrong. I know - so embarrassing... It was during my most experimental phase. I'd grown tired of conventional dishes and wanted to try something radical and new. Well, I guess I succeeded.
SkillProgress_Cooking_5_dog |= I made a delicious casserole of Fae mushrooms and hag marrow and let my trusty old dog eat the leftovers. The next morning, I woke to find we'd switched bodies. Maybe when you're worthy of further knowledge, I'll tell you how I've managed since then.
SkillProgress_Cooking_6_dog |= It hasn't been easy pretending I'm still human, you know. Luckily, my dog's spirit spends most of his time sleeping, so all I had to do was learn to be an expert ventriloquist. It took a lot longer to work out how to control my old body, but I found that by pulling on the hairs around the ankles I could make it do anything - even cook!
SkillProgress_Cooking_6_dog |= These days, I can slice an onion parchment-thin with just a couple of tugs. And my canine sense of smell has opened up a whole new world of possibilities. Still, it has its downsides. So, whatever you do, try to keep your human body as long as you can. Especially now you're so close to becoming a master cook.
SkillProgress_Cooking_7_dog |= I'm so proud of you! I knew you had it in you to become a true master. I have a nose for these things now. I baked you a whole tray of my speciality doggy treats to celebrate, but I ate them all before you came.
SkillProgress_Cooking_7_dog |= Well, I've taught you everything I know, but there are always new recipes to create, new palates to dazzle, new ingredients to discover, new posts to scent-mark... Wait, scratch that last one. Stick to the cooking.

SkillProgress_Ranged_0 |= For a while I used to live in a tree, but I kept falling out when I made powerful bow shots. I then decided that being grounded was more advantageous and less painful.
SkillProgress_Ranged_0 |= But that teaches us an important archery lesson. Life is all about balance. And so is the hunt. Your body and your breath must be in balance, but so must the forests. They need the animal population to be in equilibrium. How's that for wisdom?!
SkillProgress_Ranged_1 |= I spent years searching for the right sort of wood to make the most lethal, elegant, perfect arrows possible. Arrows that would glide and hum. Arrows that would respond to my thoughts. Arrows that would seek out my quarry and my enemy. But I learned there's no such thing.
SkillProgress_Ranged_1 |= The arrows don't make the archer. It is the archer that imbues the arrow with purpose. Make yourself one with the bow, practice the movements until they become second nature, and then whatever fills your quiver will be as deadly and true as any arrow ever fashioned. I really should write this stuff down...
SkillProgress_Ranged_2 |= I come from a long line of archers. I don't mean lots of us stood in a row. 
SkillProgress_Ranged_2 |= My grandmother was the first to put a bow in my hands. Although once I started gnawing on it, she realised I was still a bit too young and waited a couple of years before trying again.
SkillProgress_Ranged_2 |= She was quite a lady, my grandmother. She was one of my home village's founders, you know. A fierce warrior, a cunning huntress, and she could knit a pair of mittens in a flash.
SkillProgress_Ranged_3 |= When I was six years old, my village came under attack from a monstrous species that lived in the mists. Everyone looked to my mother and grandmother to defend them, as they always did. Seeing them standing there, defiant, bows in hand, I just had to join them.
SkillProgress_Ranged_3 |= Of course, adult bows were too big for me - I just couldn't pull the string back far enough - but my toy bow proved lethal enough. I was so proud that day, to be another archer in that great lineage. And I only accidentally shot one of my uncles in the leg once.
SkillProgress_Ranged_4 |= Remember how I helped to defend my village when I was a child? Well, there was another attack many years later. And the creatures came in greater numbers. We managed to repel them again, but my grandmother didn't make it this time. She killed scores of the beasts before she went down...
SkillProgress_Ranged_4 |= That's when I decided I would do anything to become the greatest archer Quill had ever known, so I could hunt down every last one of those foul creatures. I set off into the mists and became lost, and ended up here. It was then that Fairweather came to me in a dream... But I'd rather not talk about that.
SkillProgress_Ranged_5 |= I don't want you to think my life's been all death and gloom. There have been plenty of laughs along the way, and there's nothing I like better than a good party. Just ask the folk who hosted the archery drinking contest a few years back.
SkillProgress_Ranged_5 |= For every shot you drank, you had to shoot at a target. After a while, there were arrows flying in all directions, but even after downing 7 tankards of beer I still hit the bullseye every time. I just couldn't remember my name or where I lived.
SkillProgress_Ranged_6 |= I remember what it was like to be where you are now, on the cusp of complete mastery of my skills. I could have done with a bit more humility back then, to be honest. I wanted everyone to know just how good I was. But a coven of witches who specialise in bringing people down to size taught me a lesson.
SkillProgress_Ranged_6 |= To be exact, the size they brought me down to was about two and a half inches. Then they dropped me off next to a pond full of carnivorous toads with nothing but a pack of toothpicks to defend myself. Luckily, the curse wore off after three days, but toads still make me squirm. 
SkillProgress_Ranged_7 |= You've made it! You now stand shoulder to shoulder with the greatest archers who ever lived. Just remember that this achievement comes with great responsibility. There have been archers who used this level of skill for terrible things, gorging on their hunting prowess and wiping out whole species.
SkillProgress_Ranged_7 |= But the true hunter understands that the prey is not some lesser being to be slaughtered. It is a noble creature who is elevated by the hunt, and one whose carcass must be treated with respect. But enough of the serious talk. Time to get hammered and celebrate!

SkillProgress_Fishing_0 |= The trick to being a great fisherman - or woman! -  is to think like a fish. I call it "Method Fishing", 'cos it was Billy Method who first gave me the idea. He couldn't get out of his room, see, and kept banging into the walls with a kinda glassy look in his eyes.
SkillProgress_Fishing_0 |= So now I like to get into "fish" character the same way. Just make my mind a blank slate, which is easier than you'd think, and bump around until I find myself sitting on a rock with a rod in my hands. Works like a charm!
SkillProgress_Fishing_1 |= Don't trust anyone who tells you they sell magic bait. "Guaranteed catches," they'll say. "Attracts all species like a magnet," they'll add. "Here comes that idiot Twig who always buys my rubbish," they'll mutter. Well, I'm on to them now.
SkillProgress_Fishing_1 |= I figured out that the stuff they sell is magic alright - it just ain't bait! What it does is it sends mental messages to the fish and convinces them you're not to be trusted. That's why I always wear this hat now. Tells 'em I'm alright, see?
SkillProgress_Fishing_2 |= I wasn't always the famous, successful fountain of wisdom you're looking at now, you know? Back when I was nothing but a minnow, everyone told me I was as useless as bog roll in a leafy forest. But the moment I held a rod, I knew I'd found my calling.
SkillProgress_Fishing_2 |= Mum and dad went from making me sleep with the pigs to giving me my own basket by the fireplace. Oh, my brothers and sisters sure were jealous. But it was me putting food on the table. So keep at it, and maybe you'll get a nice, cosy sleeping basket one day too.
SkillProgress_Fishing_3 |= Just got back from a lovely fishing trip,  catching Fae fish. They're the hardest to catch and the trip is something else.
SkillProgress_Fishing_3 |= You can look into those pink rivers and just get the urge to dive in, but you would likely not get out again!
SkillProgress_Fishing_3 |= I only go to such places once every so often as a treat, or when the fish here get a bit too snappy.
SkillProgress_Fishing_4 |= Don't mind telling you, first time Mr. Fairweather showed up in one of my dreams, I was scared outta my wits. "You're not Mr Cuddly Bunny," I said. That's who usually showed up in my dreams. Big, nice white rabbit, he was.
SkillProgress_Fishing_4 |= Guess that's how Mr Fairweather got the idea for my new look. I always did want to be a bunny. Probably 'cos I had so many brothers and sisters, I dreamed of being an only rabbit. Anyway, I still dream of Mr Cuddly Bunny now and again, but now he can't make fun of me having human ears anymore.
SkillProgress_Fishing_5 |= Have you ever wondered where all the fish come from? I mean, who put them in the water? Did they fall out of the clouds? Did they just walk there and then forget to use their legs? I've been trying to get the answers out of them for years, but they just won't tell.
SkillProgress_Fishing_5 |= I got close to finding out one time. I caught this absolute whopper who coughed up an old boot. So I figure, either a one-legged man carried the fish there and then the fish ate him, or all fish used to be cobblers who had a change of career. The mystery continues...
SkillProgress_Fishing_6 |= Look at you! Always knew you had a knack for fishing but wasn't sure you'd ever get this far. Won't be long before you're as good as old Twig hisself. Gooder even. Until then, you've still got a few things to learn.
SkillProgress_Fishing_6 |= Like, for example, did you know taking your fishing tackle into the bath is a bad idea? Learned that from personal experience. Also, worms are not as delicious as fish would have you believe. And don't get me started on yellow snow!
SkillProgress_Fishing_7 |= It's the new fishing master! A pity that I did it first, so you can't take my job and long life. Well done, my old pal. You know, the hardest thing about being a master isn't teaching stuff. That's kinda neat. No, it's the living all this time while everyone else stops. Mum and Dad went a long time ago, and even my brothers and sisters died so long ago, I hardly remember their faces.
SkillProgress_Fishing_7 |= But I must have some great-great-great grandnieces and nephews out there. That's what I'd like to do one day. Find old Twig's relatives and maybe teach them how to cast a line too. That way I won't have to fish alone no more.

SkillProgress_Melee_0 |= Here's a riddle for ye that's been fiddlin' my mind for years now: why do they call it melee? Is that not the strangest word ye ever heard? Melee. Melee. Melee. Downright odd, if ye ask me. Ye'd think the art of bashin' each other with stuff would have a beefier-soundin' name.
SkillProgress_Melee_0 |= One theory I heard was that, back in the olden days, there was a gal called Mel who'd just knock your stuffin' soon as look at ye. And when that happened, everyone'd laugh and say "Mel, eh? What's she like?". Can't say I believe it, but it does appeal to the romantic in me.
SkillProgress_Melee_1 |= We've got a lot in common, you and me. Grew up on a farm too, though I don't much like to talk about it. I mean, the great Jogon, picking apples? Feeding pigs? Downright embarrassing. Not that there's anything wrong with farming, mind you. More power to ye.
SkillProgress_Melee_1 |= Still, it never sat well with me. But there's more to my dark past, so ye might as well know. My uncle...he played the lute. Och! And my very own mother... I can barely bring myself to say it. She was a poet! The shame of it!
SkillProgress_Melee_2 |= If ye're anything like me, ye'll have no patience for bullies, ruffians or ne'er-do-wells. Always bring out the beast in me, they do. First time it happened, I was wee nipper. I saw this grubby kid steal a lassie's milk flagon. Wasn't gonna stand for that.
SkillProgress_Melee_2 |= I got hold of my rattle, charged at the wee bampot, and whacked him but good, right on the noggin'. Aye, that rattle served me well in those early years. That's the thing about being a true warrior. Ye can turn anything into a mighty weapon. 'Course, a good blade is always better!
SkillProgress_Melee_3 |= Ahh, I do love a nice, big weapon. After all this time, I kinda feel naked without one. It'd be like not having a beard. Ye treat yer weapons right, and they'll take good care of you. Keep 'em nice and clean, stroke them gently, sing 'em lullabies...
SkillProgress_Melee_3 |= I like to sleep with at least a couple of sharp blades, in case of a night attack. Ye got to be careful though. Can't tell you how many times I woke up full of cuts and bruises. Why ye think I wear a metal jockstrap to bed?
SkillProgress_Melee_4 |= A true warrior's nothing without a juicy quest to sink yer teeth into. I bet ye've had quite a few good 'uns to get this far, but I ain't much of a listener, so ye can listen to one of mine instead. It was the quest to find the finest blacksmith in all of Quill.
SkillProgress_Melee_4 |= There'd been rumours of this legendary anvil smasher for decades, and I was determined to track her down - for the talk was of a woman with arms as thick as logs and a strange kinship with metals of all kinds. Aye, I was in love without ever having set eyes on her. But if she did exist, she proved too hard for me to find. I suspect I was chasing a fairy tale and nothing more.
SkillProgress_Melee_5 |= That's some fine hittin' and slashin' ye've been doing. Yer a boar's hair away from being every bit the master I am. Although at my age I don't get out as often as I used to. Not many folk come up saying "Jogon, please slay this beast for us" and "Jogon, you owe us a sack of Brass for smashing up the tavern". Not anymore.
SkillProgress_Melee_5 |= Rather be left alone anyways. I got my hobbies. Hitting trees, coming up with new porridge recipes and, most of all, collecting weapons. Just can't decide if I like swords or bigger swords best. Might have to fight myself to put that thorny issue to bed once and fer all.
SkillProgress_Melee_6 |= As I live and breathe, a master warrior! I always knew ye had it in ye. I've nothing left to teach ye, so go out there and make weaklings everywhere tremble at your might. Aye, there's nothing quite as satisfying as clobbering the heck out of something, don't ye think? Sound of bones cracklin', a nice big skull conkin' out...
SkillProgress_Melee_6 |= Got to be careful not to get carried away though. Seen many a fighter taking things too far. So don't you ever become a bully, 'cos you know how old Jogon feels about bullies. Yer a master now, and with great power comes something else I can't quite remember. I really should stop head-buttin' things...
