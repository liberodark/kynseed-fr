Dear <PlayerName>,

I must admit I am a bit shy about this subject, as it is very sensitive. I am basically just wanting to get it off my chest. It is so difficult to express, but I think I am in love with Lucy Arrows. I know she doesn't have an interest in me, though. I am but a lowly woodsman at heart. So I am at a quandary of what to do about it. I hope you do not mind me writing. Please keep it to yourself.

Your friend,
