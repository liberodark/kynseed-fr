Dear <PlayerName>
Some advice for you this fair day.
A watched pot eventually boils. A bird in the hand makes a terrible mess. A rolling stone is probably still alive. Lay with dogs, wake with dog breath. A problem shared is a problem halved, unless it is the runs. Bad news travels fast, and even faster on pig-back. Home isn't where the heart is. It is inside your chest.
Think on these pearls of wisdom as you enjoy this gift.
