Hello. 

I am wondering if you could help me? I am in need of a brave and adventurous young soul and I think you fit the bill quite nicely. Plus you live nearby!
Please meet me tonight anytime after 6pm at the henge in North Gate, not far from my house.

Bring a lantern!
Kind Regards
Lucy Arrows
