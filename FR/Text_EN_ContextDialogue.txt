CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_WEALTH_WEALTHY |= I never dreamed I would be married to a money machine.

CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_ACTIVITY_GET_HONEY |= Fill a jar and you'll go far.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_ACTIVITY_GET_HONEY |= Just collecting some sweet nectar, my friends.

CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_GOOD_NEGATIVE |= Oh. Still married happily, unfortunately.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_GOOD_NEGATIVE |= No idea why your spouse is still with you.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_GOOD_NEGATIVE |= How does your spouse put up with you?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_GOOD_NEGATIVE |= Is your spouse blind AND stupid?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_GOOD_NEGATIVE |= How can your spouse not smell you and leave?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_POSITIVE |= Sad to see you both struggling.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_POSITIVE |= I thought you would both be happy longer.

CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_NEGATIVE |= Spouse finally woke up eh?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_NEGATIVE |= You should divorce and marry a fish.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_NEGATIVE |= Happy to see you so sad.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_NEGATIVE |= Couldn't happen to a worse person.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_NEGATIVE |= Relationship on the rocks like your brains eh?

CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_NEGATIVE |= Sad to see your love life suffering. Not really.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_RAINING |= Raining again!

CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_RAINING |= It's spittin'!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_RAINING |= Bit of rain hurt nobody. Except witches.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_SNOWING |= Bit of snow hurt nobody. Except witches allergic to snow.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_SNOWING |= Snow joke!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_SNOWING |= Every flake is unique, like my warts.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_SNOWING |= Ahhh the tingle of snow on my nose.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_SNOWING |= It is snowing. Obvious flavour text!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_SNOWING |= Snowflakes are like my dandruff.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_SNOWING |= What a bunch of snowflakes.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_SNOWING |= Need to sit by a hearthstone in this blizzard.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= I can't see fertiliser.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= I mist my turn off!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= It's a real leek souper.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Who goes there?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Am I even on the right road here?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= It's pretty murky out!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= I can't see anything.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= I need to get myself a horn.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Mister Mist go away!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= It's a foggy compo to find Clegg.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Gone but not fog-otten.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Dragon's breath!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Watch yourself in this fog!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Mind your step!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Aurore's farts it's foggy out!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= This is spooky.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Fog chills your spine.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Carpenter's love a good fog.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Stephen was king of the mist
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Fog off!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= I think I set my socks on fire.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= I am having brainpoops.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= What was I saying to myself just then?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= This fog is as thick as I feel.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= Which way wasn't I going?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= I've forgotten more than you know.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= Who am I again?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= Hey look! It's...erm...shapes?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= Is it just me or is everyone stupid today?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= I could charm the horse off a shoe today.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= Can't see much in that fog. Nor think much.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= I just thought up an equation. I think it's a type of newt.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= I would forget my own head if it wasn't nailed on with string.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= My head feels as empty as my larder.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= What was I walking this way for?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= Oh dear, I put my underwear on upside down.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= What...is...ummm....thingy?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= I wouldn't look in my brain today. Nothing down there.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= It's this thick fog that soaks your brain through.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= Am I being dumb or am I just being dumb?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= It's obvious 2 plus 2 equals 22.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= This fog is about as dense as me.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= I would happily buy a straw hammer today.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= My IQ is easily about 14, and I don't know what IQ is.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= Did someone just walk off with my brain today?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= I can spell every word beginning with 7.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= I think I forgot to go to the toilet just now.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= A person could get lost in this erm, frog? Fob?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= I couldn't charm the ears off an eel right now.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_RIDING_PIG |= Be careful with that thing.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_RIDING_PIG |= Have you passed your pig riding proficiency test?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_RIDING_PIG |= Ride carefully!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_RIDING_PIG |= Look at that pig fly!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_RIDING_PIG |= Trot along!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_RIDING_PIG |= That pig smells of pepper.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_RIDING_PIG |= Woah there!

CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_PLAYER_FISHING |= You are doing it all wrong.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_PLAYER_FISHING |= Supper ahoy!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_PLAYER_FISHING |= Something fishy going on here.

CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= I love a good competition.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= I hope we don't get the same winner this year.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= It's not just down to raw skill; you have to be intelligent enough to know what items to display.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= Maybe I should enter this year?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= I can almost taste the entries already.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= I hope there are some meals left after the judging is over.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= Am not a bad cook myself when I'm not burning things.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= We should do this every year rather than annually.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= It puts me in the mood to buy lots of food.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= Will the winning entry be available to buy?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= Hmmm those smells!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= If I cared for autographs I would ask for one.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= It must take great skill to win. Or culinary bribery.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= A cook with good stamina will go far. Literally.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FISHSHOW |= This is exciting! Fish ahoy!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FISHSHOW |= If I had a bigger rod I would enter.

CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FISHSHOW |= Fishing is a handy skill to have.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FISHSHOW |= I love seeing what people catch.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FISHSHOW |= A highly skilled fisherman will win.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FISHSHOW |= Do we get to bake the winner in a pie? Fish I mean.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FISHSHOW |= I am hooked on this event.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FISHSHOW |= This event doesn't smell as nice as the bake-off.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FISHSHOW |= Don't flap trying to win!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FLOWERSHOW |= What a great smell!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FLOWERSHOW |= I love seeing the best bloomers.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FLOWERSHOW |= I thought this was a flour show?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FLOWERSHOW |= I wish my gardening skills were good.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FLOWERSHOW |= The secret is in the soil, you know?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FLOWERSHOW |= I wonder who will win.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FLOWERSHOW |= I'm a Flower Show stalker.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FLOWERSHOW |= Dying to sniff the winners!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FLOWERSHOW |= I have blue fingers not green.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FLOWERSHOW |= Beautiful flowers!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_VEGSHOW |= Some great-looking veg this year!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_VEGSHOW |= I hope we can taste the winners!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_VEGSHOW |= Lovely big veggies!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_VEGSHOW |= I wish I could grow quality veg.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_VEGSHOW |= I need a leek!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_VEGSHOW |= Competition is fierce this year!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_VEGSHOW |= Who has got the goods?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_VEGSHOW |= This is the greatest talent show.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_VEGSHOW |= Very impressive entries.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_VEGSHOW |= Is that podium strong enough to hold them?

CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_STORY_PROGRESS_WITCHSLAYER |= Impressive Hag-slaying!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_STORY_PROGRESS_JABBERWOCKENCOUNTER |= You saw the Jabberwock??
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_STORY_PROGRESS_JABBERWOCKENCOUNTER |= They say you saw a great monster!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_STORY_PROGRESS_JABBERWOCKENCOUNTER |= You survived the Jabberwock?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_STORY_PROGRESS_JABBERWOCKENCOUNTER |= Are you lying about that monster you saw?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_STORY_PROGRESS_JABBERWOCKENCOUNTER |= I am not going near Toughwood!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_STORY_PROGRESS_JABBERWOCKPRESENCE |= There's something foul afoot.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_STORY_PROGRESS_JABBERWOCKPRESENCE |= Have you noticed a presence?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_STORY_PROGRESS_JABBERWOCKPRESENCE |= Ill-moods from the north.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_STORY_PROGRESS_JABBERWOCKPRESENCE |= There's an ill-wind blowing.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_STORY_PROGRESS_JABBERWOCKPRESENCE |= Something nasty is afoot.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_STORY_PROGRESS_JABBERWOCKPRESENCE |= A darkness is spreading!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_STORY_PROGRESS_JABBERWOCKPRESENCE |= I heard a monster is loose.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_STORY_PROGRESS_JABBERWOCKPRESENCE |= Careful up north!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_STORY_PROGRESS_JABBERWOCKSLAIN |= You killed it! Hero!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_STORY_PROGRESS_JABBERWOCKSLAIN |= Slayer of Jabberwocks!
