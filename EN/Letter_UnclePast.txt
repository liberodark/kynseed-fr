Hey, you!
When Uncle Bill passed into nature, I went through some of his things. I took a few things with me and was just leafing through them when a small note fell out of a book.
It said, 'If you find this note, then it is presumed I am gone. This book contains the clues to where I buried it. Where I buried my past.'
I looked in the book, but my words were never as strong as my actions. Can you work it out? It seems like you should try. You might need a really good shovel! Something of Fae metal might do the trick! Shatterwrist or something; I can't recall the name. Good luck.
