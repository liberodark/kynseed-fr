SiblingTaskIntro |= Well, that's one way to get out of doing any work. Why didn't I think of that?
SiblingTaskIntro |= Weird dreams, huh?  You should hear about the one I had last night. But not now. We're supposed to be doing our chores, remember?
SiblingTaskIntro |= And don't pretend you lost your Journal, lazybones, because I have it right here!
SiblingOnApproach_PAD |= Come talk to me. <holdInteractGamepad> <interact> and select Talk.
SiblingOnApproach_KBM |= Come talk to me. <holdInteractKBM> <interact> or Left Click and select Talk.
SiblingWaitNoTalk_PAD |= Hey! Talk to me when you're ready, eh? (<holdInteractGamepad> <interact> and select Talk)
SiblingWaitNoTalk_KBM |= Hey! Talk to me when you're ready, eh? (<holdInteractKBM> <interact> or Left Click and select Talk)
SiblingWaitNotReadTasks |= Are you going to read those tasks or not? I've not got all day y'know. Press <calendar>.
SiblingWaitMapCheck |= Are you going to look at your map? Press <map>.
SiblingWaitInventoryCheck |= Are you going to look at your satchel? Press <inventory>.
SiblingReadTasks |= So you noticed the job I added, huh? Well, it IS your turn. It's right there on the calendar. I check mine every day to make sure I don't forget things.
SiblingReadTasks |= And maybe when you have time you can work on that map you're always going on about. Thought you might like it with you.
SiblingInMap |= Doesn't look like you've got far mapping the local area. Better find some MAPSTONES around the farm so you can work out where things are.\nOh, and you've got a World Map on the other side. Nice!
SiblingAfterMap |= I almost forgot. Uncle Bill got us a satchel each so we can carry anything we need. 
SiblingAfterMap |= They're a bit old and musty, but they're OURS! We never had anything like this back at the Shoe.
SiblingAfterInventory |= Anyway, I think that's it. Maybe once you've finished your chores you can start exploring. 
SiblingAfterInventory |= Can't wait to have adventures myself. I mean, isn't this place amazing? I still can't believe we're here.
SiblingAfterInventory |= I always day dreamed some relative would show up one day and take us away from the Shoe, but I never thought someone like Uncle Bill could really exist.
SiblingAfterInventory |= Oh that's right! He wanted to talk to you about something. Better pop over to the house and see what it is.
SiblingSigns |= It was nice of uncle Bill to leave little signs around to help us. You should try reading them by interacting or using Left Trigger / Left CTRL. I know you can read.
SiblingGeneral |= Haven't you got work to do? It's good exercise.
SiblingDay2 |= Ah you are up! Off into the village, I hear. Don't get lost! Oh, yes, before I forget, did you use Bubble Help yet? It lets you see certain interactive objects onscreen. Try it now by pressing <bubblehelp>. Then press <ui_accept> or click on a bubble to get more info. Easy! Go on, give it a go!
Day2BubblePrompt |= Are you going to press <bubblehelp> or not? Then highlight and select one of the bubbles with <ui_accept> or by clicking on one.
SiblingDay2AfterDadFollowup |= You heard uncle Bill. You are the lucky one to get to go out of the farm. Don't forget that bucket!
SiblingDay2Followup |= Another busy day. I hear you are going to the village. Be careful out there and don't go wandering too far! We children need to be in bed by 11. Adults are so lucky!
SiblingDay2FollowupBegone |= You better get going...and don't be distracted if you see a Wottyzit!
SiblingDay2FollowupBegoneOLD |= I like our uncle Bill. Let's make him proud. He said if we do well we might even get a bonus! I think that's to do with bones?
SiblingDay14 |= Is that... is that you? I don't believe it! I thought I'd never see you again! Where've you been??
SiblingDay14 |= What do you mean "you don't know"? You've been gone 5 years. You left us, left ME, without saying a word. We could have run away together, but you just disappeared. Just abandoned me.
SiblingDay14 |= You're not making any sense. I tried looking for you at first, but Uncle Bill made sure I always came back. Didn't want to lose me too. Then he started getting sick and I had to stay and look after him. Somebody had to...
SiblingAfterD14 |= After that it was my turn to leave. There was no point sticking around. Only reason I came here today is because it's my birthday. OUR birthday. And I thought... I don't know what I thought. I never want to see this place again. Far as I'm concerned, you can keep it. What's left of it.
SiblingAfterD14 |= Oh, before I go, take this. It's a key to that door we always wanted to look behind. I just couldn't bear to open it, but maybe you should look inside yourself.
SiblingAfterD14 |= I'll be in town for a while, maybe see what's going on at the Festival Green these days. You know, if you want to say goodbye before I leave. Oh, and... happy birthday.
SiblingGoodbye |= I used to think this is why you ran away, because of what happened here at the Summertide Festival. Now it turns out it was Fae magic that took you. But it was still your decision, wasn't it? That's how it works with the Fae. You have to be the one who says "yes".
SiblingGoodbye |= At first I hated Uncle Bill for letting Aunt Rose die like this, but they both really believed in this stuff. Everybody does. So I don't know. Maybe they're right.
SiblingGoodbye |= What I'm trying to say is... I hated you for a while too. For leaving me. But maybe that's the way it was supposed to be. So... I'm glad you're back and that you're alright. But I've got my own life now. Finally exploring the rest of Quill like I always wanted. Who knows? Maybe we'll run into each other again one day. Goodbye.
SiblingLeaveMe |= I am going to stay here a while and just clear my head. Please leave me be
