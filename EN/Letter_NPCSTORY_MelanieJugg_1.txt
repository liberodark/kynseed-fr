Dear <PlayerName>,

I have something I need to urgently get off my chest, and no, I don't mean that! I have been unable to sleep lately for thinking of what is best. I love my father immensely, but he is really dragging me down into the murky waters with him. I even fantasised about offering him as a sacrifice. I think that is when the cockerel crowed for me, and I woke up. Something needs to be done. I will think on it, but I just had to tell you. I have no idea why! You must be a magnet for the world's problems, and I don't know what a magnet is.

Your friend
