Fairest friend
I am writing to let you know that whenever I am sad, I picture you running around, collecting everything that isn't nailed down, as though on some mystical quest for greatness.
Your energy is relentless, and your will is boundless.
Great fortune to you, friend, and please accept a gift to add to your collection!
