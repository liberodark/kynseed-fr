Dear Pal

Great news! Mr Fairweather wants to meet you! He asked me all about ya! He said if I bring you to him, you can see if there's anything ya want. Meet me outside yer house at midnight, end of Day 14 after Summertide. 
Mr Fairweather says don't worry about wakin' up...the dream is the door!

Your new Pal
