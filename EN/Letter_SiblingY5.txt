Dear <PlayerName>
It has been a while, and I am sorry for not getting in touch sooner. I was gazing out of my window and saw a cloud that looked like you. It made me smile, and I knew that was the time to pick up my quill.
I took bitterness and sorrow with me the day you returned, and they stayed buried deep as a dagger.
The northern air has since cleared my mind, and I look back on those times with great regret.
There was anger and upset, but know that I still love you and care about you.
I have been building my life up here. I have a cosy home, a beautiful white cat called Cloud, and I grow wonderful vegetables that I sell to wanderers who pass my door.
Please visit me. There is something I need to discuss with you. I discovered something that I feel you need to know about it. So come to my house in Stonecrown, north of Mellowfields.
I am sure I will be proud of you even if you have accomplished nothing, but I hope you are making a name for yourself. I prefer being alone, away from the noise of the world. I write my books, I cook, I stroke my cat, make my offerings and I look at the stars at night and see the past in their glimmering light.
Stay safe, lazybones and come see me soon.
Love always
