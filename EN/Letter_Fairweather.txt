Greetings once again. 

It was but five years since our pleasant introduction.
Now you are ready to forge your name in history.
Do not worry yourself over the passing of family. More will come, and you will doubtless be reunited.
I took thought of your answers to those questions asked by our energetic friend, Pott, and have a small gift for you to help you on your path, even if just a fraction.
Until our next meeting.

Fairweather
