To whom it may concern,
Someone found my buried chest and took our family heirloom. It was an incredible diamond-studded sword that could cut through stone.
The thief must have snagged their tunic on the chest and left a piece of cloth we used to track them down.
Unfortunately, their footprints headed towards Midwood, and there is no way I could go in there. 
Find our sword, and I will reward you with another legendary item that I do not cherish quite as much.
