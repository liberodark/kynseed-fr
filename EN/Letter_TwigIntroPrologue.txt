Dear Pal

My name is Twig and I am inviting you for a visit. I got told you would make a great friend.
I live in the Nook north of your farm, just across the river.
My hut is right at the top of the Nook. You can not miss it!
To help find me, just follow the Thatterway. You are bound to have one in your hair!
Looking forward to seeing you soon so we can do some fishin'!

Your new Pal
Twig
